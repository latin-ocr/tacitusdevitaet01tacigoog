Tun deviatione from the text ol Halm⁴ here noted iollow the
bracket— G. R. reiers to my Notas to caesaraeae in the Classical
Reciso, vol. XI. (1891), pp. 325-332.-F. to Fumeaux‘s edition,
onero, 1898.-A(r) = Vat. 3429; Β(Δ) = 17664498.

Chapters, line 12. eet] et-MSS. Seeldadloc.

4, 16. ultraquam] ultraque qaam-Baehrens. cp. Ο. R. 325.

4‚17. cesenaten] (cesenaten). caussas. Andresea(and
F. isdisposed to agree with him) has objected to this deletion on the
ground that senatori may be taken in an anticipatory sense, as in Dial.
28, 3, principes liberos (destined to be leaders) and Ana. 111. 69, rec
torem pencris hamoni (the future ruler). This explanation would be
acceptable ii the text read cc carescit, expressive ol the highest attain-
able gaal, as in tho examples just cited; but to reach senatorial rank
was certainly no conspicuous achievement‚ and its mention immedi-
ately upon Romano is in the nature oi an anti-climax.

6,18.20. proconsule. . . proconsule] proconsulem . ..
proconsul.

6, 27. tenor] locutor-MSS. No satisfactory emendation oi this
admittedly corrupt reading has yet been proposed. Teaor (Rhena-
nus) gives a tolerable sense, but it is paleographically out oi the ques·
tion, and the word does not occur elsewhere in Tacitus. Cp« (7.11.
325.

6, 29. medlo rationis] acedia moderationis. cp. QB. 326.

6, 2. eliecit] fecit—MSS. cp. Cic. ia Verr. V. 2, 63 ovid, ea
Poat. I. 1, 65. ’

8, 23. dignum eet: Tacitus elsewhere omits the copula after dia· '
acmandiadipaam. See O.R.326. Ihave now retained it with the
MSS. because the ellipsis ol the copula had not yet reached the pro-
portione it had in the later writings. See Iatrod. p. xxxii. Pessibly
also, as Andresen suggests, it may have been here designedly expressed
to prevent crat irom being understood.
