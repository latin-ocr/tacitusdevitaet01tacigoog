That this treatise fully menits the designation just given
to it will be manifest from some considerations of a more
external nature.

In the first place, the arrangement of the multitudinous
details is of crystallina clearness, the work being divided
into two distinct parts. The first (ch. 1-27, 1) deals with

and considered as a national entity. The various topics,
moreover, follow in a most natural order, being often intro
duced by skilful transitions,1 and the entire discussion most
appropriately eloses with an account of German funeral
eustoms. The second (ch. 27, 2-end) takes up in detail the
specifio history and characteristics ol the indiuidunl tribes,
the author pursuing‚ as before, a consistent and carefully
devised plan in their enumeration’ Throughout the treatise,
finally, Tacitus is fond of rounding off a topic or chapter by
an epigrammatis phrase³

As the Germania is primarily a scientific treatise, the
canons and exigencies of ancient rhetoric forbade its being
