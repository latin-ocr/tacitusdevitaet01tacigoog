upon those who lived through these dreadiul times. multi . . .
promptissimus ortisque. . . pauci: notice the asyndeton. ior·
emus ossibus: owing to natural causes. 001100. XII. 52, morte
fortuite supercrescentem extinctus. Tacitus means to say that during
the reign oi terror most of the illustrious men capable oi telling its
story had died a natural or violent death, while the few that survived
were too orushed in spirit and unlike their real selves 1ο undertake
the tash.

24. promptissimus quisque: the plural verb after 001οᾳ00, witb
' or without the superlative, is found in all periods of the language, but
is comparatively rare 10 classical prose, except in Livy.

2⁵. ut ite dixerim: like its 000100100101010111001101(0011101.
34, 23), 10 0 post-Augustas phrase ior at 110 dicam. -The socalled

logical perfect subjunctive in subordinate clauses is very rare. —The ·

expression is here used to apologiae ior the seeming paradox in nostri

sucgetrzezmpffl e medie vita tot annis: elsewhere in Tacitus

exiam invariably takes the dative-medic 0110 10 00 clastic term.
Thus in ch. 44, 26, 11 10 applied 1ο Agricolaat the age of 54. Accord-
ing to a belief common among the Romane, 120 years constituted the
extreme natural limit 01 human life. Tacitus himself was about 26
years old on the accession of Domitian (81 nn), and therefore but
4l at Domitian’s death. Senectus usually began at the age 0160.

27. ipsos exactae aetatis terminos: tothecerplimitsefeatreme
old ope. Such iullness 01 expression, still frequent in the minor
writings of Tacitus, gradually disappears in the later works.

28. per silentium: ie. in compulsorp silence, because of the
danger to which an honest blstorian or biographer would have exposed
himself. nontamen: 10 spite oi the terrible ordeal through which
we passed.

29. pigebit . . . composuisse: the perfect infinitive refers 1ο the
time when the implied action is completed. Cp. Verg. Aea. Vll. 233,
aee . . . excepisse pigebit. vel incondita ao rudi voce: these
terms are habitually used 01 00 archaic and inartistie diction, but as
the Historias here alluded to-they were not eompleted till 109-are
written in a style of consummate art, these epithets must not be taken
too seriously. Similar apologetie or mech-modest expressions occur
elsewhere, eg. Cic. Orat. 69, 230(00000101004100001010100οᾶ0011οο
to bis Punic War); Stat. Sile. Ι. praef.; Apul. Met. Int1·od.; Fronte,
p. 242; Aelian, Not. Hist. IV‘. 1 ii. 5 1100012761.
