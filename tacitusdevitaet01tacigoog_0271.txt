talre it all the more to heart, 11 their women are captured. Nomine, a
phrase seemingly taken irem commercial lile occurs repeatedly in
Tacitus and elsewhere. Sacrani is superfluous, but here adds a touch
01 affection. Cp. also ch. 13, 10; 30, 24. Translate: They tave aa
intolerabie dread os captivitat, and sear it all the more in tte cose
of their oran nornen.

19. animi: peaceabte disposition, tite bearis, the civitas being con-
ceivcd rather as an aggregate 01 individuals than a political organiza-
tion. Similar quasi-personiiications are frequent, eg. Aac. 19, 22;
Hist. 1. 78; civitatum et provinciaram animos adgressae· IV. 66,
percuisis civitatum animis.

20. puellae quoque nobiles: the stress, as shown by 000000, 10
00 puellae. The emphatic position 01 the adjective was, however,
necessary to avoid the collocation inter obsides nobiles, paellae 000000,
which could only mean that the affection iu which the Germane held
their women rendered noble birth a less essential qualification than in
the case oi the male hostages. With the statement itseli, cp. Suet.
Octev. 21, 0 quibusdem (sc. civitatibus maie quietis) uero novam 00000
obsidam sentinas ccipere temptaverit qaod negligere naariam pignora
sentiebat ; and ch. 20, 4. Inesse: sc. ,reninis anis, easily supplied
irom th'e context. quln etlam: on the collocation, see note
ch. 3, 29.

21. aliquid: on the medial position, see 10000. p. lxvi. provi-
dum: prescierit, inspired. This beliei is abundantly attested. Cp.
Caes. RG. 1.to,4; Suet. Viteil. 14, vaticinante Chatta 00011000 cni
velut 0000010 acquiescebat (sc. Vitellius). The Gothic king Filimer,
a Christian, expelled magas medicaea, and references to them are fre-
quent 10 the Teutonic epics. The tenacity with which such women,
in particular, would cling to pagan traditione made them an especial
object ο1 attack on the part 01 11ιο Christian propagandists. By the

time oi Charles the Great their influence seems to have been broken, ·

and we hear no more 01 them, until they revive in the witchea oi the
Middle Ages. nec: aeacidae, as often in Tacitus. consilia
. . . responsa: the former, as shown by adspernantur, are unso-
licited. Sc iar, Tacitus nreans to say, are the Germana from being
indifferent to the answers oi their wise women, that they do not even
reject advice which they had not themselves requested. Cp. Plut. de
ninlier. virtut. 6 (p. 246 C.) 01 the Celts: περὶ πολέμου καὶ εἰρήνης
βουλευόμενοι μετὰ riou γυναικῶν.

22. Vidimus: Tacitus might have seen Veleda in his boyhocd
