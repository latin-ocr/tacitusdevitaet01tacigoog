litted eyes, his hands being now ires, picks up,' etc. The suppositicn
that the coelum suspicere was called ior ιο girarti against dishoncsty on
the part oi the diviner is incompatible with Tacitus' account oi the
Germane generally. Their nalve religicus saith was as yet untainted
by scepticism or suspicion. See below, l. 22.

12. ter singurios: three times he piched up runes, one at a time,
ie. three different runes out oi the entire number spread on the white
sheet. sublatos: viz. illos tres surculos. impressam ants
notam ie. the previously inscribed ideogram, ior the runes repre·
sented not mere letters but words.

1³. interpretatur: points cut their meaning, by combining the
three runes into an answer. Cp. Caes. B. 6. 1. 63, 'lis (sc. Iulius
Procillus) se praesente de se ter sortibus consultum dicebat utrium igni
statim necaretur ca in aliud tempas reservaretur sortium beneflcio se
esse incolumen. From this it would appear that the lots were cast a
third time ii the answer was negative in two previous instances. From
'l'acitus we further learn that an affirmative auswer called ior other
confirmatory omens, which might, however, be secured the sanie day.
A strikingly similar mode ci divination is attributed tc the Scythians
by Herod. IV. 67. prohibuerunt sc. notae or sortes. nulla . . .
consultatio: in strong contrast with the method followed by Roman
haruspices, who continued their divination, till they secured the
answer they wanted.

On this common ellipsis, see eh. 19, 14; 23, 12 ; and note Apr. Intrcd.
p. xxxi. 3. adhuc: further, ἐπὶ τούτοις. See ch. 29, 13; 38.
27; note Apr. 29, 6. iides: confirmation. ‘stt . . . quidem:
continuative, with the adversative particle omitted, as usually. See
note ch. 6, 9.

16. hic: oi the country under discussion, illic ng perhaps
avoided, because iilud just preceded. Cp. ncta ch. 3, at. avium
voces volatusque ι On these alliterative groups characteristic oi the
Latin language, cp. ch. 27, 30; 31, 16 ; Istrou. Apr. p. xxviii. Ιι seems
that, while the ltcmans paid attention to the direction oi the liight, the
number, and other details, the Germans divined rather from the
arrival or non-arrival oi the birds ; some, as the owl and the cuckoc,
portending disaster, the eagle and the raven, good fortune. pro-
prium: the same mode oi augury was, however, known to tha
Homeris Greek (Iliad XIX. 405), and is attributed to the Persians by
Herod. 111. al, 3. See also Min. Pel. Oct. 18, 6, omitto Persas rte
