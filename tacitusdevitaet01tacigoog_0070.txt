(b) Of writers dealing with Germany, either exclusively

his share, both in matters of detail and in suggestiveness,
to make the (immania what it is. To assume a direct
influence of Sallust, however, is unwarranted, so long as
the very existence of au alleged contribution of histo the
geography aud ethnology of Germany must bc seriously
questioned. On the other hand, Liup's treatment of the
subject was undoubtedly known· to Tacitus, but as the
former's information was derived wholly from one or two
sources which the author of the Geraiania also knew at
first hand, aud, when it is added that our own treatise
exhibite no significant parallelisms with Livy's style, any
direct indebtedness to this historian is, to say the least, not
intrinsically plausible.
