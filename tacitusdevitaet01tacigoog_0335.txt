Iu the reign oi Tiberius, they occupied the territory once belonging
to the Sugambri, on the right bank of the river. They had
fought Lollius (17 aa), Drusus (12 an), and y'cined the Batavian
uprising in 70 sn. The Usipi seem to have been finally subdued in
the reign oi Domitian, and they are found among the auxiliarios oi
Agricola in 83 sn. Cp. Aps. ch. 28. Their casual mention her'e may
well be due to 'Tacitus's aversion tc credit Domitian with their subju-
gation. What is said oi the Tencteri was in all probability equally
true of the Usipi; at least, Caes. IV. 12, l f. confirma their² equestrian
skill. colunt: accolunt, darell along.

30. super: as in ch. 30,4, solitum: he. over and above the
military prowess which they share with the Germane generally, the
'Tencteri excel in horsemanship.

31. apud chattos. Tencteris: on thisvariation, character-
istic oi Tacitus, cp. Introd. Agr. p. xxxiv. 2. With apud, eg. usse.
Il. 78, apud ipsum . . . sperantibus, V. 4; Ann. IV. 68.

Paga 49. 1. instituere, eto: adversative asyndeton with chies-
mus. Cp. Introd. p. lxvii.

2. Hi . . . haec, etc. = cnm epicis indunt insontes, invenes aetnae·
tantan, perseverant aeneo, the pronouns being attracted to the verbal
nouus, and the severalelauses being arranged in a kind oi chiastic order.

3. Inter: aionpwithaspartos. familiam et penates et lura
successionum: elaces, and honsehold poecis, end other lepitintate ob-
yects os inieritcnce. On the common ellipsis of cetera, eliu, cp. note
chlo, 15.

4. maduntur, etc: if the statements in this passage, in spite
ci ,their rhetorical coloring, ere to be accepted as on the whole
trustworthy, Tacitus attributes the custcm oi primogenitura and testu·
tion to the Tencteri (and Usipi), as something peculias tc them
alone, for the iormer is significantly omitted in ch. 20, tn, while the

’ absence oi wills is especially noted as characteristic of the Gemens

generally ; but the prout seron, etc, could only have been determined
by the testator in ease there were several adult sons. We are not told
what disposition was made oi the eqni in case there were uo children,
or only daughters, surviving. excipit implies that the son adjudged
the bravest could claim the horsea at enee, without waiting ior the
regular distribution oi the rest oi the estate. lt is, however, intrinsi-
cally improbable that all the horsea should have been given to this son ;
more likely only the favorite steed of the lether passed to him.
