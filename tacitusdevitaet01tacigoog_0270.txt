adversa. vulnera ierunt: a bold expression ior ‘they return and
show their wounds,’ ie. the unmarried to their mothers, the hus-
bands to their wives, not the same individuals to both, as not all the

interpretation.

necessarily said in contrast with the conduct 61 Roman women under
alleged similar circumstances, ior women would naturally recoil from

tion, here polysyndetlc, to brlng out each 6161116111 into special reliei,
is, asusually in Tacitus, amplified. Cp. Introd. p. lxvii. Gontianaas
