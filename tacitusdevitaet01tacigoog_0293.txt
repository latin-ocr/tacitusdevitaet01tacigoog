206 sorus. cemus 16. [rien 40

Ohapter 16. 18. populls: ou this so-called subiectire dative, see
note ch. 3, 30. urbis: i.e. fortified towns. The fact, to which
Tacitus here appeals as one 01 common knowledge, is amply attested
hy references in other authors lu the 4th century, victorious Ger-
man tribes were still averse to occupyiug towns which they regarded

⁶ as munimento servitii (Tac. Hist. IV. 64). This repugnauce, due

to their nomadic instincte, was not overcome till· the llth century
under Heury, the founder 01 cities (der Stddteyriloder). The late
occrurence 01 the German word Stodt (city), is also confirmative 01 the
above statement.

19. ne pati quidem: do aot take kindly to, do aot like. In this
weakened sense, pati is quite common, eg. ch. 42, 8 ; 41, 15; Dial.
10, 213 40, 26. inter ae iunctas sedis: condiacone droellt'nps. ·
The clause is joined asyndetically‚ the infinitivo depending upon
notcmcst. colunt: dwell.

20. discreti ac diversi: soporatcly aad promiscucualy. The
Latin is fond 01 such alliterative groups 01 synonyma. cp. Cic. pro
lep. Man. 4, 9, locis disiunctissimis. . . diversam Lucret. V. 1441,
divisa . . . circumactorum aud below, l. 21. ιιι. . . ut. . . ut:
note the effective anaphora. The statement is, in a measure, con-
firmed hythe endings 01 many modern city names, eg. Lauterhrun-
nen, Anabaoh (sone), Bielefeld, Lindenau (campas), Fuersteuwalde,
Wernigerode (neotus).

21. Vlcos: a group 01 homesteads. coneda. . . aedificiis
seems to be a merely redundant amplification of inter ae iunctos sedes.
cp. note ch. 15, 6. The supposition that Tacitus means ιο distinguish
the dependent larmsteads aud the dwellings 01 the free, including
the manor 01 the lord, is not confirmed hythe context, though such
differences unquestionahly existed.

22. spatio: an open space or yard feuced in.

23. sive. . . slve: these clauses are an explanatoryapposition oi
spatio circumdat, although the Germans' ignorance 01 stone buildings
isin itsell the reason, why precautious against fire were imperatively
called lor.

24. Ne caementorum.. . tegularum: explains wherein thia
inscitia aedificandi consisted, etam being, as often, omitted, eg. Agr.
13, 15. This is confirmed hythe observation that the German words
ior other thau wooden material, such as cemeut‚ chalk, mortar, hrick,
tile, etc, are 01 Latin origin. .

2⁵. materia: timber. So eg. Caes. B. θ. IV. 17, 8; Ano. 1. 35,
