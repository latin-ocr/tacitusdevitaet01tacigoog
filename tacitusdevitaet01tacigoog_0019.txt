Biography, according to all our ancient authorities, be
. longe to the epideiclic branch of literary composition, in
particular the encomium, and its rulcs arc illustrated, as
was natural, in connection with the biography oi a king,
the socalled βασιλικὸς λόγος,1 the rhetoricians usually citing
as typical models the still extant Agesilaus of Xenophon and
the Euagorae of Isocrates.¹ That the Agricola partakes ol
the character ol an encomium, amerely cursory perusal could
have confirmed, even if Tacitus had not expressly told us so
himself.⁸ In fact, the line of demereation between a his·
torical narrative and an encomium was a very slight οιιο.4
The constituent parts oi a regularly constructed encomium
arethe followingz⁶ 1. προοίμιον. 2. γένεσις, φύσις, ἀνατροφή.

These precepts present astereotyped sameness, being often reproduced
verbatim from earlier handbooks‚ and they are, one ended, ulti-
mately derived from treatises reaching back ci our era. The Romans
developcd no rhetorical systema oi their own, but began in the days
of Cicero and thereaiter with ever-inereaaing assiduity to copy and
iollow the rhetorical canons oi the Greeks. For a briei account oi
the above rhetoricians and others, see christ, Griecbisote literatur-
geschichte 8, pp. 752 ff.

¹ That its essential features are common to biographical writing in
general might have been taken for granted, even if Menander (libel.
Graec. III. 369, 25 Sp. IX. 2¹15 f. W.) had not expressly confirmed it:
ori γὰρ ἴδιον τοῦτο μόνον τοῦ βασιλέως τὸ ἐγκώμιον, ἀλλὰ κοινὸν πρὸς
πάντας τούς οἰκοῦντας τὴν πόλιν.
