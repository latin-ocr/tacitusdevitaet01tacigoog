7. Equestrium sane, etc: nor need coc wonder nt tlu's, sor, os ,

course, etc. On the ellipsis of num, see Introd. p. lxix. cito parare
victoriam, cito cedere: the former refers more particularly to reri
excursus, tho latter to fortuitu pugne. Cp. note eh. 2, 1. On the
anaphora, see I ntrod. p. lxvii. Cedere, for cedere loco (ch. 6, 23), is the
more frequent idiom in Tacitus.

Diui. 4, 14; Hist. IV. 65, the verb having the force of a reflexive or
middle, as often.

12. crinem barbamque submittere: the regular order is here
reversed, in accordance with Tacitean usage, so as to add a touch of
novelty to hackneyed expressions. Submittere = demittere, or pro·
mittere, allow to prou, used of ministeralium, as well as oi barbe, is
postAugustan. Cp. Plin. Epist. VII. 27,14; Sen. cd Polyb. 36, t ;
