The Speeches. -Ι turn to a consideration of the speeches.
It is well known that these form a conspicuous and unique
feature of classical historiography from Thucydides down
to Ammianus Marcellinus the last of the great historiens
of antiquity‚ addresses to soldiers on the eve of a battle
being by far the most numerous. These speeches, more-

prevented actual speeches of any length from being deliv-
ered at all, or, if they were, the historiari could have had
no accurate knowledge of their contents. The author,
therefore, simply put into the mouth of the speaker the
sentiments which he deemed fitting to the occasion, his
imagination being occasionally aided by reports of what
was actually said.² But whether fictitious or only partly
so, the ancient historiari invariably cast the speech into his
own stylistic mould‚ as we may still demonstrate by a com-

address of the emperor, which happens to be preserved³
But while the fiction of actual delivery is maintained
throughout, no deception was intended or involved, for
even though historiens do not, like Thucydides, take the

reader into their confidence, the speeches are always intro
