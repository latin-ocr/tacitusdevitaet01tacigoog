possessed works in abundance which could bave satisfied
this hypothetical craviug. The alleged opportuneness of the
publication of the treatise is purely accidental. Tacitus, as
he tells us himself, had written nothing throughout the reign
of Domitian (Agr. 3, 26 fs). When, with the death of the

cruel despot in 96 an, it again became possible, to use
his own words, sentire quoe celis ct quoe sentias dicere, he
also ventured to break the silence to which he had been
condemned so long, and there appeared in rapid succession

treatise, the material for which he had doubtless been col-
lecting for some time previous, and which, unlike the
excursus on the Jews (Hist. V. 1-13) οι· that on Britain and
its inhabitants (ΑΨ. 10-12), as already remarked, was too
extensive for incorporation in its entirety in his contem·
plated history of the Empire. If the Gerwaeoio could thus
not possibly have been issued earlier than 96 Ao, nor later,
for Tacitus has given us the terminas cate quem himself
(ch. 37, effi), the striking significance of the publication, in
98 an, must be pronounced purely imaginary, aud hence all
the inferences which have so freely been drawn from this
assumption fall to the ground.

But even if the conclusione just refuted were less arbitrary
and gratuitous than they are, positive evidence, destructive
oi the hypothesis under notice, is by no means lacking.

If the ,Germanic had been intended as a politica] trocturc,
it is impossible to understand why every indication of its

little, it is true, of this species of literature among the
Romans, but, though extensively resorted to in the lest days
of the Republic, it must heve been for obvious reasons ex-
ceedingly rare under the Empire. In any case, the fact can-
not be too strongly emphasized that a pamphlet which
studiously avoids everythiug of a political nature, which
