The identification 01 Germanic deities with the gods of
Rome and Greeee was familiar to Caesar.¹ This process
must, therefore, antedate the de Bello Gallico, but if so,
there is no one, save Posidonius, to whom its general intro·
duction² ean plausibly be attributed, 100100 101100 only
previous scholar, so far as known, who paid any attention
to the mythology 01 Germanic and Celtic 00000.

Summing up this entire discussion, 1100 following conclu·
siens may be set down as reasonably established: -

1. The material collected in 1100 Germanicis taken en-
tirely at second 110011,100 the hypothesis that Tacitus himself
visited German territory has nothing in its favor and every-
thing against it.

2. There is every reason to believe that avery consider-
able mass of details, 100 more than has generally been
supposed, was furnished direotly to the author by friends

1Β. (i. VI. 17, 1 ff.; 21, 2, where 100 says that Mercury, Apollo,
Mars, Jupiter, and Minerva were 1100 deities worshipped by the Gauls,
but only 1100 Sun, Vulcan, and 1100 Moon by the Gemens. See note
