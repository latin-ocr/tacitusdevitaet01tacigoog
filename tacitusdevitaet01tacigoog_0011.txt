been allowed to intrude. ln not burdening the commentary with
scrupulous acknowledgment for every real obligatior incurred‚
imperative as this would be in au edition intended for scholare, 1
have ventured to follow a well-recognized precedent. Nor have
1, for reasons of brevity, called attention, except in a few instances,
to the existence of other interpretatione than those, whether new
or old, which I deerned sufficiently convincing to warraut accept
auce. Under these circumstances 1 gladly take this opportunity
oi saying that, of all the editions accessible to me, 1 have found
those of Wex, Peter, Andresen‚ and Furneaux especially helpful
and suggestive; and I only regret that, having profited so much
bytheir labore, Ι should have been compelled to dissent from
’ their views so frequently, though I hope never without valid
reasons. That I have again made every possible use of the ad·
mirable lexicon Taciteum, unfortunately not yet finished, will be
evident from my Notes.

The text has been subjected to a thorough revision, and may
claim to represent an independent recension. It differs from that
of Halm⁴ in nearly sixty instances, the justification of these devia-
tions being given, as briefly as possible, in a Critical Appendix.
It is a matter of great regret that l had to be deprived of the
benefit which the third known Ms. of the A pricola, discovered by
Dr. R. Wuensch in Toledo, might have proved to be ior the con·

stitution of a better text than is now possible. But the most .

strenuous efforts to secure a copy, photograph, or collatiou have
been alike unavailing, owing to the unfortunate attitude oi the
prelate of Toledo, who, though incapable of reading the Me.
himself, has absolutely prohibited its inspection, on the ground
that a Me. once made known loses all its value.

In conclusion, I have again the pleasure of acknowledging with
gratitude the rnost welcome and valuable aid which my old friends,
Professor John C. Rolie of the University of Michigan and Pro
sessor Charles E. Bennett oi Cornell University, have so ungrudg-
ingly given to this boolr iu its passage through the press.
