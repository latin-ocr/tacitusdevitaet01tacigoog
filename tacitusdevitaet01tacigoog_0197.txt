1e. Suebis . . . Pristim Suebi, according ιο Tac. Gerae 38, was
a collective designation ior many tribes who occupied the greater part
oi Germany and led a more or less nomadic liie; hence their name,
which means wanderers. A Suebic offshoot was settled hy Augustus
in Flauders, and these are the people probably alluded ιο here. The
Frisii occupied the territory a little to the southwest, stretching irom
the eastern mouth oi the Rhine to the lima.

19. ln nostram usque ripam: i.e. the left bank oi the Rhine.
This proves that Tacitus conoeivcd the Usipi ιο have sailed from the
west arouud scotland, ior on any other suppositiou the adventurers
would have reached the Roman boundary before they were ship-
wreclred and captured hy the more northern Suebi and Tsisians.
· mutatione ementium: commercici excienqe.

20. inlustravit: the indicative aiter sant qai occurs occasionally
in poetry, but is extremely rare in prose. In Tacitus again Dici.
37, 27, suni opud quos . . . meretur. Herse certain number oi the
Usipi are specially siugled out irom the rest.

Ohapter 29. 21. Initio aestatis: the seventh summer, 84 an.
ictus . . . amisit: strict logic would require ictas est, yiiio entheo,
hut the participle and finite verb have a tendency to interchange their
iunctione, particularly when the two acts are virtually coincident.
The construction is a Graeciam eg. Xen. Anah. IV. 8, 25 ; Pind.
Nem. VIII. 38. Frequently in Latin poetry, eg. Lucret. V. 514; Hor.
Germ. ΙΙΙ. 6, 33; Lucan, VII. 581, but in prose ch. ὅ, 24, and Aac.
IV. 64 seem ιο be the only other analogous instaures.

2³. plerique lortium virorum ambitiose: ie. unlilre many
bravc men, Agricola did not ostentatiously display his sorrow, enchi·
tiose being often used in this sense. Hitherto plerique sortium ciro·
rnm, etc, was taken in an ironicai sense, with direct reference ιο the
Stoics, but this is incompatiblc with the antithesis in muliebriter, nor
does Tacitus elsewhere ridicule the Stoice ior not practicing the dra·
ραξια which they preached. On this truly Roman attitudc, cp. Cic.
Tnsc. Disp. II. 21, 49; Lucan, VIII. 617, aud Tac. Aac. III. 6.
per lamenta . . . maerorem: words denoting pain or sorrow are·
frequently combined in synonymic groups. Here the first more par-
ticularly expresses open, the second silent sorrow.

24. ln luctu bellum, etc: a similar conduct is attributed to
Alexander (Plut. Alea. 72) and Tiberius (Aren. IV. 8). meus:
on tie other iared. See note ch. 20, 19.
