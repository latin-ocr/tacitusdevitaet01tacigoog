neaux's edition, Oiass. 11111111, XIII. (1899), p. 213. The 11111 01 the
MSS, changed by Rhenanus into tta, which, 11 the original, would
hardly have been thus corrupted, seems to he nothing more than a
dittography 01 the final letters 01 frontem. The 0011111011 01 11, at,
ot 11 notoriously frequent, while tha ellipsIa 01 sed in an adversative
asyndeton is characteristically Tacitean. cp. latroni. p. xxxi.

1. 1.-811 0. R. 329, and F. ad loo. Prot. Mamill's suggestion, in
01011. lieo. XII. (1898), p. 355, 10 read ctiam for actem, though paleo·
graphicaliy very easy, involves 11111 contradIction 01 the context,
whether we take etiam ln the sense 01 caea 0101 0110, as is evident
11011111. . . sagacissimi and quos . . . deprehensi sunt.

36,10. equltum turmae: the explanation given in the note ad
loc, I feel convisced, disposes 01 the many difficulties to which thIs
passage has given 1111, without altering the text, although it is possi-
. hle that equitum merely represents afalse solution of the compendium
Intended tor equorum. There were 1101111111110111110111101111111;
on the other hand, tha phrase cannot he applied to the Romans without
making the entire paragraph hopelessly unintelligible; hut inasmuch
1110111101 equitum was a well-known technIcal term 1011 detaohment
01 Roman cavalry, nothing was more natural than that the scribe
01 the archetypon understood 11111111 with taratauc. But this word is
frequently used 01 1 crowd 01 herde 01 animale, and 1 10 interpret it
ln this passage, whether we actually read equorum or regard equi-
tum ln this sense as one 01 Tacitus’s many Vergilian rchnIsoences.
F. llaverfield (01011. Rea. XIIL p. 305) in a very recent reexamlna
tion 01 the fico passages, generally cited 101 the use oi eques = equas,
has deided the validity 01 this equation. His argumentatlon does not
appear convincing to me, nor do 1 see why eques may not have been
employed in the analogoust ambiguous sense that 1011111111 Enghsh,
and 1000111111 in itallan. cp. also Milton, P. L. 1. 801, 11100111 =
knights. In any case, the present passage, though hitherto overlooked,
lurnishes a very clear Instance 01 this 0011111101, every other interpre-

tation involving Insuperable difficulties.
