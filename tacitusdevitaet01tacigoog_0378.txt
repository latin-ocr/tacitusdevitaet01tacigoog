viously, according to the traditional text, said nothing about liberti,
but had spoken only oi 10101.

2110. The correct reading can no longer be determined with
confidence. 1 believe that the corruption arose out 01 1010100 ia
uiceseaaadum, the scribe having by an overslght written irater ee 101
111 less common equivalent ia rici(m), but noticing his error, he, in
order not to spoll the page, wrote the correct reading 01101 11, - 0 very
. frequent practice; or else ia 0101 was an old variant 101 irater 10 and
was accidentally inserted 01101 universis, where it yields no sense.
Some such process 01 corruption seems to me 101 more plausible than
the assumption that ia 01001 11 0 dittography 01 universis, orthat 11
represents an original 01011 (villages).

28,11. Helvetii, ulteriora Boii] Helvetii citeriora, ulteriora
Boii. Mdller, in Zeiteclt. s. deutscbea Altertli. vol. XXXVIII. p. 26,
inserted citeriora before Helvetii, which emendation was paleographi-
cally improved upon by Woelfflin, ibid. Aezeiyer, p. 207.

0101001000,000110001100010. This seems to me 0 simpler emenda-
tion 01 110 MSS. than any 01 110 numerous suggestions to remedy the
passage which have hitherto been made. chhbauer in Serta Har-
tciiaaa‚ pp. 241 11. (1896), reads detractisque (sc. sedis) dam. This
conjecture is also simple, but quite unaoceptable, because 01 110 in-
tclerable hyperbaton, unprecedentedeven in T.; nor does he elsewhere
join a participle to 0 noun, 01 the governing verb 01 0 dam clause.

30, 7. parere] parare—MSS. cp. ch. 14, 4, reliquiae parare;
24, 22, ariera paravit; Diei. 34, 121, saraam . . . parari ,· 36, 12 ;
Aaa. 11. 14 ; and frequently elsewhere in Tacitus. There is, there-
1010, no necessity 101 discerding the MSS, although victoriam parere
is a stereotyped phrase. cp. Hier. 1.tv; III. 823 IV. 79; Aria. IV.
513 XIV. 36; Liv. XXVII. 31, 3; XXX. 111. This very 1001 may
well have prompted Tacitus to choose the less hackneyed expression.
