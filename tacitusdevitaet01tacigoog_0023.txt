The Relevancy of ch. 28.-As regards the first of these ῃ

objections, it may be admitted that 9 modern writer would

11 au probability have relegatae the item 1ο a fooenote, if '

he had thought it worthy of mention at all, but this device
was unknown 19 the ancients, who were compelled to insert
such passages in the body oi the text. The episode is,

however, by 119 means as irrelevant 99 11 might seem at ¹

first sight, for it admirably shows of what heterogeneous
and unruly elements the army of Agricola was oomposed,
thus eobancing the merit of a general capable of fusing
them into an effective instrument of war, a 1991991199-
quently emphasized by implicatior, in that the decisivc
battle was won wholly by the Roman auxiliarios, of whom
the Usipi had constituted a part. Again, if the adventure
was thought by Tacitus too noteworthy and interesting 19
be omitted, it could have iound no other place without
destroying the chronological sequence of events, which
is rigidly adbercd to throughout. Finally‚ the passage
subserves a 1119199119 purpose. The author had been mar·
shaling 911 his facts to lead up to the denouement. With
the closing words of ch. 21, 3, atque itu inritatis utrimque
animis discessum, the no less excited reader feels the op
pressive calm that precedes the sturm, feels that the final
crisis is at hand, and just 99 often in the Greek drama a
soothing choral chaut precedes the catastrophe, so Tacitus
has here introduced the maguum ac memorabile facium by
way of diversior, before he proceeds in the next chapter to
the detailed story oi the final struggle, destined to prove so

after his retirement, and, therefore, Tacitus passed over the former
briefly, while the latter 919 dealt with at some length. The samo
method is 19191911 by Menander, IX. am (111. 369), 911μὴ ἀναγκαῖα
