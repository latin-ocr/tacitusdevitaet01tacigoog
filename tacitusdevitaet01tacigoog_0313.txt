Ohapter 24. 19. spectaculorum unum. . . idem: in glaring

iuvenibus. On this agreement with apart oi the antecedent, cp. note
ch. 2, 3. ludicrum est: enpcpe ia thia oport. In the sense oi
leocadie word is used first in Catull. lxi. 24; thereaiter it is quite

with an adjective is especially frequent in Tacitus. lasciviae: the
word is used in a good sense, as always in Cicero, but in Tacitus only
