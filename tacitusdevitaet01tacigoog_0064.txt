this noteworthy divergenoe, for the Chauci were a tribe well
known to the Romans, and Pliny’s description is probably
that of an eye-witness. If, therefore, the Natural History
was consulted by Tacitus, as we are essured, it is hard to
understand why he, with ⁴such trustworthy information
before him, deliberately discarded this authority in a mat

misrepresentation.
