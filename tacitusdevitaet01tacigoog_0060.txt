readily to rhetorical treatmenl, worthy of attention though
it be.

To relieve the weary monotony of geographical names
' with which the rhetorician found himself confronted, re·
course is accordingly had to stylisticembellishmcnt. As
regards ethnological details, which Mela distributes with a
lavish and reckless hand, it may be said that there is per-

haps no ancient treatise, professedly scientific and didactic, ·

which so teems with grotesque information, culled from the
rich storehouse of Hellenio fancy, myth, aud anecdctc3 for
everything is grist that comes to his rhetorical mill. Pliny
the Elder, omnivorous reader that he was, does, indeed, cite
the Chorcyruplria ol Mela as among his sources, but there
alter all genuine traces cf its ,influence disappear until
the early Middle Ages. The value which attaches to it in
modern times is solely due to the accident that it is the
earliest geographical treatise extant in Latin, and that it
contains no fewer than fifteen hundred geographica] namesl

Now, the third chapter of the third book, comprising less
than fifty lines, is devoted to Germany, and to this extremely
meagre account we are asked to believe that Tacitus was
under deep obligation for many details of fact, while his
stylistic indebtedness to this rhetorioian is made tc extend
over the entire compilation.2 But to suppose that Tacitus

¹ Mela seems to have been chiefly indebted to a geographioal work
of Cornelius Nepos, who is expressly quoted, and to some map, perhaps
that oi Agrippa. Eudoxus, Hipparchus, and Henne, though also cited,
were doubtless known to the author only at second or third hand.

2Ηονν deeply rooted this convicticn is, will be best illustrated by
the fact that all recent editors have had no scruples to change redit to
recedit (ch. 35, 2), simply because oi a similar passage in Mela, and
yet the unanimous reading of the Mes. isnot only wholly unobjection·
able, but it is supported by Vergil, and, finally, by none other than
Mela himself! See note ad loc. and Orit. Appendix.
