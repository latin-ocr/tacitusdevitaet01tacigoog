22. Dotem . . . 0110111 turs dowry represents the survival 01 the
custorn 01 wife-purchase which prevailed universally in primitive

society, but it is 1101 improbable that even in Tacitus’ time 111101111
was not given 10 the bride directly, but to the father-in-law, who

thereupon relinquished hle patria potestas. With the statement, cp.
Strabo 111. 4, 18, παρὰ τοῖς Καντάβροις τοὺς ἄνδρας διδόναι ’γυναιξὶ προῖκα;

ln poetry, esp. in Lucretius, Catullus, Propertius and Vergil, but,
naturally rare in prose. Cp. eg. Plin. Epist. V. 6, 10, inde campique,
campi; Panep. 65, lapibus srebieeisti, lapibus ,· 82, leosttam prospec-
