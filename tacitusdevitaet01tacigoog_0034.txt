STYLE AND RHETORIO. XXV

listic originality, may well have exerted a powerful attrac-
tion upon a mind such as Tacitus’s. But, at the same time,
he seems to have been captivated by the nobility of Ver-
911100 diction. In the Histories and Annulo hc to some
extent emancipated himself from the style of Sallust, but
the influcnce of the great poet never waned, remaining eon-
spicuously in evidence in all his works

In the Agricola these two streame still blend in happy
harmouy, producing a style as far removed from the ‘milky
richness’ of the Dialogus as it is from the succinotness oi
expression in the Histories, or the still greater conciseness
of the Ananis. Buta man of such literary gifts as Tacitus
is never a mere imitator, and hence we find that certain
features characteristic of his mature and developed style
already appear in the Aprtoolc, his earliest treatise of an
historical character. The most noteworthy of these are a
straining ior the utmost brevity, which occasionally resulted

in obscurity, anda deliberate avoidanoe of the commonplace,
the trite, or formulaic, which led him to coin new expres-
sions, or to give a novel turn to old ones.

The following surrey aims to give in a conveniently tabu-
lated form a collection of the most interesting stylistio and
rhetorical features met with in this treatise.¹
