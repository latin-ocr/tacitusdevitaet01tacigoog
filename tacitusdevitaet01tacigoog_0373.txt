opus esset: according to Socrates, to desire little is divine, but he
who desines least isnearest to the godhead. These half-human sav·
ages have, however, gone even beyond this. Tacitus in his rhetori-
cal ssight has here reached the grotesque. cp, however, Justin 11.

24. cetere lam fabulosa: 011 else suom lvere ou belouqs 10 leqend,
implying that the preceding statements were, in 'l'acitus' judgment,
satisfactorily authentia. Hellusios: Plin. N. H. IV. 14, 27, 96,
probably mentions the same people under the name Hilleuiones, but he
places them in scandinavia. Oxibnes: the MSS. have different
readings, such as Etiouos, which is preferred by some; but neither
name occurs elsewhere.

25. ore, etc: the imagination 01 the ancients peopled these un·
known regions with many similar monsters, and even as late as Adam
of Bremen, we learn of men with canine heads on their breasts, of
cannibals, Amazone, and giants. Norae mythology issignificantly 1011
01 like creaturas. lt is, however, quite possible that the particular fact
here reported may have been based upon the impression which men
covered with the skins 01 wild beasts made upon Roman observers. A
similar statement is found in Tac. Ana. 11. 24, umbipuus bominum
et beluarum seruans, and the ut incompertum, ete, implies that he
was not quite prepared to reject these reports as impossible.

26. 10 medlum relinquam: Aulus Gellius (N. A. XVII. 2,11)
says that 10 medio was the more common, but that the accusative is
probabilius siqnifcuutiusque, it being used on the analogy 01 the Greek
θεῖναι ἐς μέσον. “
