Briefly stated, their contentiori is this: The Germanicis
a politicnl pamphlet, written as a kind oi vade amcam for the
emperor Trajan andin opposition to a poweriul jingo party
in Rome which, it is alleged, clamored ior a progressive
polioy and vigorous offensive measures against the Germane.
Trajan, who had now for two years been occupied 'with re-
storing order and discipline among the Rhenish legions, and
had been antively engaged in iortiiying the frontier line
against Germanic aggression, received the news oi his suc-
cession to the throne sometime in 98 An, buthe did not
return to the city till 99 am. All eyes were, turned to the
north, all Rome was on the qni nice, so we are told, as to the
ultimate outcome oi the emperor's activity. This condition
oi suspense naturally awakened renewed interest in the
history, origin, customs, prowess, etc, of Rome’s inveterate
hut still unconquered foes. The appearance in 98 mn. oi
the ‘Germania oi Tacitus was, therefore, singularly well-
timed, and, composed as it was, hy a distinguished states-
man¹ whose consular term oi office had just expired‚ the
treatise must have created something of a sensation and
proved an effective weapon in the hands oi the supporters
oi Trajan's alleged defensive policy. ’

In this entire argumentation, everything is puro assump
tion. There is no evidence of the existence oi an expansion-
ist party; none that the Romans at this particular time
craved ior enlightenment and instructiones to the character,
customs, and location oi Germanic tribes, especially as they

tlon ago, have only recently (1898-1900) been published as vol. IV. oi
'his monumental work, the Deatsche Altertltilmer. See esp. pp. 11-17.

¹It is interesting to observo how the advocates oi this theory never
iail to speak oi the staresman Tacitus, although he was at the time
known to fame only as an orator, nor have we any evidence that
would have entitled him to that designation at any other period ln his
career.
