sidered, namely‚ Sallust and Liuy. Both were held in high
esteem by Tacitus,¹ and Livy's description oi Britain was
demonstrably known to him, while Sallust served as his
model for historieal composition.¹ There can, therefore, be
no doubt that he was not likely to have ignorod any·
thing these famous historiens had written concerning
Germany.

But that Sallust had given an account of the tribes and
customs oi Germany in an excursus of his Historias, usually
cited by grammarians under the title of de situ Pontico, is
an arbitrary assumption which is in no way strengthened
by the incidente] mention oi the word Germani in two
isolated fragments.³

iiam—Ltuy, on the other hand, did deal at some length
with the geography and customs oi Germany.⁴ But as his
sources can have been none other than Caesar and probably
Posidonius⁵ it were rash to assert, in the absence oi all
definite elews, that Tacitus is directly indebted to Livy3 nor

has his style left any but faint impressions upon the later
historian⁰
