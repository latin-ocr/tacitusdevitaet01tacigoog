HIS school edition of the Aeneid is designed to furnish a

helpful guide to the intelligent reading of the poem. lt
aims throughout to render all requisite aid to the pupil of aver·
age ability and preparation.

The Introduction contains a short outline ol classical mythol· ’

ogy, a brief presentation os the principles os prosody, suggestions
as to the translation of Latin poetry‚ and explanation and illus·
tration of grammatical and rhetorical figures.

The Text contains Books 1·V1‚ VIII, IX, and brief selectIons
from the other BookS, thus enabling the student to secure a
connected idea ol the story ol the Aeneid as a whole.

The Notes give aid of the right sort, in right measure, and at
the right time. They avoid prolixity‚ dulness, and obscurity‚
and assume neither too much nor too little knowledge on the
part ol the student.

F. W. Atkinson, Princhtal of Hae'gh School‚ Sprr'ngfield‚ Mass: l like the
notes partIcularly well: they show a good deal ol common sense, to
say nothIng ol scholarship.

D. W. Lothman, Central Hr'gh School‚ Cleveland, 0..· 1 have examIned
with some care Comstock's thil¹ and l am pleased to say that I regard
itas an excellent editIon. The sections which have been added Iroin the
last Books of the Aeneid IurnIsh excellent material lor sight reading. . . .
But the real merit os the book lies ln the notes, whlch are compact and
to the poInt¹ and ought to do much to get both pupils and teachers away
hom the usual stereotyped “school-boy translation ” to real English.

W. P. cepe, Principal os High Schoel, Hammon, 0, .· Ι have examined tt
carefully‚ and I like it better than any other editi0n that 1 have seen.
It is written to assIst the pupil and not to display the learnIng ol th'e
author. . . . ln short‚l think Comstock's Virgil au ideal text-book.

Journal of Pedagogy, December, 189⁶: Altogether this edition by Mr.
Comstock is one ol the most satislactory that has appeared Iu this
country.
