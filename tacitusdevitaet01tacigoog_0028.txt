writer, however fresh his sorrow or pungent his grief, never
forgot that he was primarily an artist and hence, while col·
lecting such consolatory commonplaoes as seemed called
for, he, at the same time, spared no effert in presenting
thern in stylistioally elaborated form. Now the marvelons
achievement of Tacitus consiste in this. Although many of
the pathetic sentiments in the olosing paragraph are mere
rhetorical τόκοι,1 he has, nevertheless, succeeded in creating
an indelible impression of genuine sorrow, affection, and
deep sihcerity.

We, therefore, conclude that the Agricola of Tacitus is
exactly what its author says it was — a eolopistio biography,
constructed, as we have seen, on fairly orthodox rhetorical
lines, more particularly in accord with 'the detailed rules
governing the Bastarnis λόγος, preserved in Menander’s περὶ
ἐπιδεικτικῶν, which, though of a late date, merely reflects
orthodox, scholastic traditione. But these, in their suh
stance, far antedate the time of Tacitus himself. ’

THE PURPOSE OF THE ecmcom.

Wholly distinct froin the discussion of the structural
character of the Agricola, though habitually confounded
with it, is the controversy which has been raised regarding
its real purpose. Tacitus, it is true, has here also expressly
