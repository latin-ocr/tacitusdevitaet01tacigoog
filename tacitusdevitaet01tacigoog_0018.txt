LITERARY CHARACTER OF THE AGRICOLA. ix

It is asserted that the work contains too much historica]
matter for a biography and too many biographical features
for a history. In the second place, the detailed account of
1111 ethnology and geography of Britain, and the elaborate
speeches put into ths mouth of the Caledonian chieftain
and of the Roman general on the eve of the decisivo battle,
are pronounced to be wholly out of place in a genuine
biography. One scholar even went so iar as to maintain
that all these alleged irrelevant portions, to which he added
the twentyeighth chapter, commemorating the adventure
of the Usipi, were not originally designed to form an in-
tegral part oi this trectise, but represented certain prelimi-
nary studies of the author, the results of which were to
be incorporated into his Historias, in the narrative of the
British campaigns under Domitian. Apart from other con-
siderations to be mentioned presently, this hypothesis
makes it extremely difficult 10 understand why the last
book of that work was not published till reattractus
hadas carly as 97 already begun tha collection of his ma
terial for the reign of Domitian. As a matter of fact, we
happen to know that as late as 106 111 was still searohing

But these objections are unwarranted, ior not only do the
alleged sections so confidently pronounced irrelevant suh
serve 1 definite and legit inrate purpose, but- what has
hitherto been overlooked—r itcan be shown that Tacitus
has carcfully conformed to the rules of rhetoric laid down
for biographical 00111001111011.2
