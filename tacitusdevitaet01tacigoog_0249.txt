Oceanus: here the North Sea. ambit: a poetic expression but
frequentin poet-Augustan prose. In Tacitus again, Hist. lv. 79.

4. sinus: peninsulas with winding shores. For this meaning, cp.

former was down to the early Middle Ages invariably regarded as au
island. inmensa: although Τ161116,11111611116 influence 61 Vergil,

ened 6616661 orcynus (cp. oh. 31, 22; Ayr. 10, 13), 1116 word is here,
as ingenti in ch. 36, 2, best taken in its regular meaning, because

generally possessed as to the extent 61 these northern regions. cp.
Plin. N.H. IV. 13, 27, 96 f. insularum tanceasa spatio=tnsalae

and below, ch. 2, 11. The 11161111111411661. 5, 26, 14 11, aud Plin. N. H.
11. 67, 67, 167, seem, however, to leave no doubt that Tacitus bere
alludes more particularly 16 the expedition 61 Drusus in 12 n.c., when
Ι the Romane 161· 1116 first time carne within sight 61 the Danish coast.
Cp. also note ch. 34, 27. coguitis: 111 auibus cogniti 111111, em-

would be out 61 place, as this mountain was a thoroughiare between
the north and the south 116111 time immemorial. Both sources were,
however, well known to the ancients and, in consequence, Mt. Adula
was 61161 wrongly identified with the Gotthard in connection with
the source 61 the famous river.

8. versus: not the preposition, but the participle used 11 11161161
