or edge of the disk-shaped earth. -The phenomenon 55 555 mid-
night sun is here given expressly on the authority of others (adfirment)
and, as amatter of 5555, 15 is not observed in even the most northerly
regions 55 Caledonia In Germ. 45, 27, 55 15 more accurately ascribed
to Ncrway.

Pege 9. 1. Scilicet, ete: this fanciful and somewhat obscure
explanation was adopted by Tacitus from some earlier and unknown
pseudo-scientia. It impliee the belief, generally rejected even in an-
tiquity, that the earth was a circular shield or concave disk, the sun's
shadow being supposed to cause night. On the presumably western,
nnobstrueted edge (extrema et pieac terrorum) the ehadow cast would
below, falling far beneath the heaven with its stare3 at the center the
more extended curvatura of the suriaco would project it to a somewhet
greater height, thus bringing on deeper darkness, while at the opposite
extremity there would be no ehadow at all, or perpetual daylight.
minema et plana: except in Sallust such substantival adjectives are
found in pre-Tacitean prose only if they eonvey a partitive meaning. Ἰ

¹ 2. eaelum et sidera: on this collocation, see Introd. p. xxx.

3. praeter: acceptata, aeomparatively rare usage. In Tae. again:
Hist. V. 8, 10; Aac. I. 13; XIII. 19, 45. oleam vitemque et
cetam. . . sueta: every frequent collocation in Tacitus, 5555515-
ing a group, followed by an independent element with et. In this
treatise again, eh. 25, 24.

4. terrie: the ablativo of place where, though extremely common
in Tacitus, is still rare in the minor writings. Cp. eg. ch. 25, 24;
33, 22 ; 45, 3; Dial. 13, 21. orlrl sueta: so Sall. Hist. fragm. 1, 9.
frugum patiens, fecundum: gielde, or rather obeunda 55 fraite,
exeepting such as grow only in warmer elimatas, like that of Italy. -
secandam is added asyndetically to quality patiens, which is at best
avague term and therefore liable to eonvey 5 false 5555555155.- With
the phrase, cp. eg. Lucan, IX. 857, impatiensque solam Cereris.

⁵. tarde mitescunt, 5155 proveniunt: an adversative, notan
enumerative asyndeton which would involve an unealled for hysteron
proteron. So exaetly ch. 3, 19. -proventunt cannot here signify
proclamaverim (its usual meaning, with srape‘s and the like), for
this would be incompatible with tarde mitescant ; but it is used in the
very rare sense oi coming forth, sproutt'ap, eg. Plaut. dape. II. 1, 26
svs. 223) ; Tac. 15555111. 65.
