N this book the essential facts of Latin Grammar are pre·
sented within the smallest compass consistent with high “

scholarly standards. lt covers not only the work of the pre·
paratory school, but also that of the required courses in college
and university. By omitting rare forms and syntactical usages
found only in ante-classical and post-classical Latin, and by
relegating to an Appendix theoretical and historical questions,
lt has been found possible to treat the subject with entire ade·
quacy in the compass of 250 pages exclusive of lndexes. ln
the German schools, books of this scope fully meet the exacting
demands of the entire gymnasial course, and those who have
tried Bennett's Grammar find that they are materially helped by
being relieved of the mass of useless and irrelevant matter which
forms the bulk of the older grammars. All Latin texts for read·
ing in secondary schools, recently issued, contain references in
the notes to Bennett's Latin Grammar.

Professor william Δ. Houghton, Bowdoin College, Brunswick, Maiae:
The Grammar proper is admirably adopted to its purpose in irs clearness
of arrangement and classitication‚ and in its simplicity and precision of
statement, giving definitely just what the pupil must know. and not crowd-
ing the page with a mass of matter that too often disheartens the young
student instead of helplng him. I trust it will come into general use, for
1 think for the reasons Just given, and because of its moderate compsss
and attractive appearance. studente are likely to get more practical gram·
matical knowledge out of it than they generally do from the larges
grammars.

John tt. Peon, Oberlin Aramo, Oberlin. Ohio: Bennett's latin Grammar
was adopted as a text-book in Oberlin Academy in 1897. It is proving
itself a very satisfactory text-book and increasrngty popular. Τὴο teaehers
of Latin in Oberlin Academy are thoroughly satisfied with the book and
trud it exceedingly helpful in their work.

the critic, Feb. 29. 1896. The book is a marvel of condensed‚ yet clear
aud forcible, statement. The ground covered in the treatment of forms
and syntax is adequate for ordinary school work aud for the use of fresh
men arrd sophomores in college.
