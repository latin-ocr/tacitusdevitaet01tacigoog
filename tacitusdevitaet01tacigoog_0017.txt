viii INTRODUCTION. II.

His 'design of writing the history of Augustus¹ and of
Nerva and Trajan² seems to have been frustrated by his
death3 at least no such worhs existed in the time of St.
J erome (fourth century).

nint mntem cmncnnn OF THE humecta·

The opening chapter oi the introduction (leals exclusively
with the biographical and autobiographical treatises oi
former times, the Agricola being expressly designatcd asa
vitu defuncti hominis at its close. Two other instances of
biography are added at the beginning of the second chapter,
and in the epilogue the biographical character oi his work
is again crnphasized by the author.⁴ But in spite oi these
explicit statements modern scholare have persistently re-

fused to accept Tacitus's own classification oi this work,

on the ground that the treatise flagrantly violatas certain
alleged canons of biographical composition, which must, of
course, either have been unknown to Tacitus or deliberately
ignored by him. But when the problem arose of assigning
to it a more suitable designation, a great diversity of opinion
was revealed, partly due to an habitual confusion with the
question as to the purpose oi the treatise. Eliminating
this for the present from the discussion as irrelevant, we
find that the principal objections against the assumption
that the Agricola is a biography resolve themselves into two.
