an ‘s’ So perhaps also 37, 22, turnus, sed for humus et, as suggested
by Halm.

31, 16. ln patientiam bellaturi] inpoenitentium ornan tuturi-
Wex; inpoenitentium latur·i-MSS.-The emendation of Wee is by
far the simplest oi the many suggested, and is highly satisfactory in
sense. I can see no force in Woelfflin's objection that the Britons hed
already taken up arms, and could not, therefore, be said taturi. Nor
can I understand why Tacitus (as F. ad loc. maintains) should have

shrunk from using a perfectly intelligible phrase like orma serre in ,

paenitentiam. Paenitentiam might of course be regarded as the false
solution of the compendium ior potientium, which, be it observed,
isnot found in the MSS. ; but even ii it were, the former would be
the difficilior lentie, because a less oomnronplaoe, and therefore a
more Tacitean, antithesis to libertatem than patientiam. We shall
take up anns against the Romans, says Calgacus, in the hope of secur-
ing our liberty, and notin the expectation of having ever to regret ·
the attempt, as was the case with the Brigantes.

32, 9. alla: possibly this represents the compendium for aliena, a
reading highly suitable to the context, but see note note ad loc.

33, 1. virtute vestra] virtute et—MSS.-Peter alone of recent
editors has defended the traditional reading, but I cannot accept his
reasons. imperinm Romanurn does not merely represent the substitu-
tion 61 an abstract for the concrete, but is clearly a persenilication used
to avoid the mention cf Domitian, for the successes referred to belong .
for the chief partin the reign of that emperor, Peter erroneously sup-
posing that the abstract was employed 6ο as to include Vespasian,
Titus, and Domitian. 'lire Empire once personified, it was as natural
as it was legitimste to predicate vinus, or any other quality of it.
See also note ad loc. intemperatos, had no hesitation in restoring
the reading of the MSS.

33, 9. montesve] montesque-Urlichs. The suggestion ol an
alternative is quite out of place, the aim of the speaker being to give
a cumulatius effect in the enumerationes the hardships the Roman
soldier had overcome. The collocation, paludes montesque etflnmino,
is, moreover, exceedingiy common in Tacitus, -ve -et, not being found
stall. Cp. note ch. 12, 3.

33,11. acles] veniunt-Schoene3 animas—MSS. Dore uei

occurs only in Vel. Flaco. V. 617, and should, therefore, not have Ἴ
forced upon T. veniunt, though not a certain emendation, gives?
excellent sense aud is methodicaily as justifiable as ecies,
