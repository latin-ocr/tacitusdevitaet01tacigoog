21. militares viri: a phrase 01 frequent occurrence in Tacitus,
designating men 01 rank and military experience as opposed to the
common utilitas 01 the cohort. Here 11 may be rendered officere.

22. expugnati: 01 persons first in a single passage of Caesar, vic.
B. (l. Vll. 10, 1, then repeatedly in Livy, ag. XXII. 30, 2, and in later

, prose. limite: the celebrated limes Romanus or frontier line of

defences, stretching from the Rhine near cologne to Ratisbon on the
Danube, a distance 01 380 miles. Domitian had built and laid out a
considerable part 01 it. ·

23. 01 ripa: here and dem. 28, 18, 01 the Danube, but elsewhere
in Tacitus, when used absolutely, it refers to the Rhine, the con-
text preventing any ambiguity. - The et is epexegetic, 11101 10 10 say.

possessione: sc. provinciarum.

24. dubitatum: was in question, ot stote. With the phrase,

tt'm discordie domi; XXXI. 41, 11; Lucret. 111. 11.

25. omnis annus: year oster year. funeribus: deutha. In
this signification, the word is poetic and in Tacitus found only here,
though he repeatedly uses it in the equally poetic, but rare, sense of a
dead body, a meaning unsuitable 10 the present passage. posce-
batur . . . Agricola: 01001101100100111000111-011010111001101οω

habitually avoids omnibus aiter forms in -ibus, using coiectis or
universis instead.

27. constantiam: intrepldity, opposed to formido, as ciperem to
inertia. expertum bellis animum: unless Tacitus wrote belli,
as in Verg. Aen. X. 113, belli inexpertos, Hist. IV. 16, militem . . .
expertamque belli, it will bc preferable 10 take bellis in the sense
of proeliis, so eg. Hist. IV. te, signum belli Betooun dubit, ior
Agricola's military experience was confined to the war against the
Britons. On et after an asyndeton, see Iatrod. p. xxviii.
