*was a peculiarly imperial characteristic, to which a mere subject

ought never to lay claim, for its possession involved an eminente tou
exalted to be overlooked, besides suggesting odious comparisons with
an emperor so lacking in this very quality as Domitian. -On the
predicative position of the attributus, see Introd. p. xxv.

16. exercitus: wroupbt up hy aaut reflectione. quodque . . .
erat: in appositior with the following clause.

1⁷. secreto sno satiatus: i.e. having fully indulged in his char·
acteristic secret hroodings over this matter. -Note the alliteration. —
With the statement itself, op. Plin. Pcaep. 48, inmanissima bellac

the transition to the next chapter, dealing with the events immedi-
