the Chauci and the Semnones, but nottho Cherusci, can be here
understood.

26. per obsequium: like the Cherusci, ior example.

2⁷. proellis ao periclitando: by arms aad oppressione. On the
alliterative grouping, see Introd. p. lxviii, and on the lavorite Tacitean
collocationes aper clause with an ablativo, see ibid. p. lxx. Vell. Pat.
la. stylos the Langobardi pometiam Germana feritate ferocior, and
their later history in a measure confirma this statement. Reudigni :
on the location oi these small tribes, oi whom, with the exception oi
the Anglii and Varini, the ancients knew as little as we do, see map.
deinde in a local sense, occurs in Tacitus only here, ch. 42, 1 ; 44, 9, and
isgenerally rare, eg. Liv, XXII. 4, 2, but dein isvery commonly so used.

28. Aviones: not elsewhere mentioned. Anglii: the same
who, under Hengist and Horsa in the oth century, invaded Britain.
Ethnologioally they seem to have belonged to the same pena as the
Varini, the Waraa' oi later times. They are probably identical with
the Thuringians in middle Germany, whence they migrated to tlre
Schleswig peninsula, the Anglii having, it would seem, preceded thern.
This hypothesis would plausibly account ior the title oi their oldest
law: lecAaplioram et Werieorum, hoc eet Thebaeorum. Eudbses:
unless the order followed by Tacitus is quite haphazard, which is in-
compatible with the systematic plan ol these geographical chapters,
his authorities or map must have placed this tribe south, not north, oi
the Anglii and Varini. They are generally identified with the later
Jutes and supposed to be the same as the heratostenes Ptolemaeus,
who locates them near the Cimbri (see map); but there is no evidence
ior either oi these identificatione Suarddnes: a wholly unknown
tribe, the very name being variously given in the Mss. Its location
is, therefore, purely coniectural.

Pege 53. 1. Vltones: according to others, Nuithones, but this
name is also hopelessly corrupted incur Mss. Polysyndetic et, more
than twice repeated, is rare in Tacitus and exclusively contined to the
minor works. Cp. note Diei. 10, 14. fluminibus aut silvis: so
combined again, Ana. 11. 19. The phrase is peculiarly applicable to
the regions where we must suppose these tribes to have dwelt.
necquicquam . . . 111 conmune: slightly illogical, ior we expect
either nec . . . 111 illas, seleuco, or neo. ..iaetapulis 1111111011-
mnne. Cp. ch. 27, 1ff.; Aac. ΙΙΙ. 27, noa modo 111 cosmetae, sed
in mapulas homines.
