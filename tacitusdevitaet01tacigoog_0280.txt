de maioribus: perhaps those enumerated in ch. 22, 21, to which
may be added electione of the princeps or duc (cb. 7, 29), and ques·
tione involviug life and death.

³1. omnes=oi πάντες, the plebs. So frequently, especially in
antithesis. Cp. cb. 17. 43 46, 4 ; Dici. 40. 18. ea quoque, eta:
ie. ree maiores.

Pago 38, 2. nisi quid fortuitum et subitum incidit: except in
the ease os un unexpected aad sudden emerpenep. The two adjectivae
are often combined, as in Diui. 10, 30; Aac. XV. 58, but usually in

the sense of extemporaneoue speech. certis diebus: see note ·

oh. 9, 26.

3. incohatur luna aut impletur: on the medial position of the
noun between two verbs, cp. note, Diui. 31, 53 Introd. Ape. p. xxvi.
The calculation by lunar months invariably antedatee the soler calen-
dar, the new or full moon being, moreover, among most races regarded
as particularly propitious. So the Spartans refused to light before the
full moon (Herod. VI. 106), and Ariovistus awaited the new moon
before engaging 111 battle (Caes. B. d. I. 50, 4). Tacitus does not state
that these meetings took place every two weeks, and they probably
did not, -but simply tbat they would not be called except at euch
a time ior the reason given. Cp. the Anglo-Saxon Andreas 1071. ι
they held caer ecuncil uslei· thirty ar'pleta.

4. agendis rebus: sor the transactioa of business, to be taken
generally, not merely with reference to the solimoot or assembly.
The final dative 01 the gerundivo, aiter· an adjective, occurs in the
minor writings only here; aiter verbe, Ayr. 23, 21) ; 31,11; 45, 22;
and once aiter a noun, Apr. 22, 9. 111 the later works, 211 these con-
struetione are exceedingly common. auspicatissimum initium:
eo similarly, Quint. X. 1, 85, a. exordium.

5. Neo=noa ideo, aad hence. So oiten in Tacitus. noctium:
this was the natural outcome of rechoning time by the moon'e changes.
It ie still in vogue in Arabian and Hebrew ritual, and ie attributed by
Macrob, Sat. I. 3, to the Atheniens oi historical times. Engl. scrtniptt,
seanipdt (now obsoleta), treelsth night, bellendem Germ. Weihnachtcu
(Chrietmae), Fustrrecht (Lent), are all survivale oi the same cuetom.
cp. also Caes. B. G. VI. 18, 2, 01 the Gauls, apetie omnis temporis
1102 numero dieram aed noctium finiant. In Greek and Norse my-
thology the day is accordingly conceived aethe eon oi night.
