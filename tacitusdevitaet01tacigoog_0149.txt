20. saevitum: sc. esse. triumviris: sc. capitalibus, the official
executionem. The delegation oi the duty of burning condemned books
to these iunctionaries instead oi to the aediles was intended asan
additional degradation. -The earliest recorded instance oi this prae
tice is the burning ol„ the alleged books oi Numa in 181 nc. During
the empire such penalties were not uncommon. The biographies
mentioned by Tacitus were the last so dealt with, the inefficacy oi the

· proceeding having gradually become apparent.

21. comitio ac loro: the comitiam was situated north ot the
soram and was the usual place ior punishments. The apparently
pleonastic soro is added to emphasize the publicity oi the transaction.

· losophy does not represent T‘s personal convictione, ior it strangely
contrasts with ch. 4, 15 ii. (where see note). lt seems here to be due
to a desire to stigmatize an act ol Domitian at any price, lor Vespa-
sian, styled by Tacitus patientissimas ceri, had previously iesued a
similar decree.
