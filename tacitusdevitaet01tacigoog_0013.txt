tions, progranrmes, etc, as I had been unable 1ο secure, were
happily accessible to me in the Bodleian Library and the British
Museum, during the summersos 1898 and 1899. For the sty-
listic treatment I bave as heretoiore mainly relied upon my own
collectanea. · ,

The text 91 this edition, though it departs from 199191 Halm⁴
in more than fifty places, is conservative, for in eighteen instances
Ireturn to the MSS, while in the others my readings are either
not without some MS. authority, or else the correction is 91 199
simplest description possible and imperatively demanded by the
context or by Tacitean usage, as will be evident everi from
the necessarily brief discussion in the Critical Appendix.

Special pains have been bestowed upon the prosody 91 199 proper
names, so iar as thip may be determined by their occurrence in
poetry and the Greek transliterations, conflicting though their
evidence 91199ἰῇ The linguistic criteria so constantly employed
-Ι have found quite unreliable, partly because of the doubtful
etymology 91 199 names themselves, partly because they have
passed through a process 91 Latinization with all 199 prosodical
changes which that involved.

The innovation 91 superimposiug the modern upon the ancient
map, designed to obviate the frequent necessity or expediency 91
consulting two mapa, will, 1 hope, commend itself to teachers and
students alike.

In conclusion, I acknowledge with profound gratitnde the 19-
valuable benefit which this book, in its passage through the prees,
has received at the hands 91 my friends, Proiessors Charles Ε.
