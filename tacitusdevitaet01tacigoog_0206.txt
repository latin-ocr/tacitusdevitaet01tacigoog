(IV.) 13, 383 Lucan, VII. tu, modern lauguages being often more
precise and analytic than the Latin. vacua catella: abandoned
forts. Probably rhetorical plurals, like coloniae below, the statement
being an intentional exaggeration.

Chapter 33. The speech of Agricola (33, 311313) is pitted,

ation isrepresented as critical ; there isan appeal to the valor of the

soldiers, the rewards of victory and the dire oonsequenaes of a defeat
