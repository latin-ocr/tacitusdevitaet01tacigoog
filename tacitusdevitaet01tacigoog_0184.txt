19. laureatis: sc. litteris. The laurei, being the symbol oi martial
victorias, was sent with the official reports which commanders lor·
warded to the emperor. —The elliptical phrase seems to ocem only
here and Hist. III. 77.

20. lamas tamam ior a similar chiasmus, cp. Anu I. 39, lepa-
tus popuii Romani Romanis in castris. aestimantibus, etc. : ie.
people reasoned that a still greater future was instare ior a man who
could be reticent about achievements so noteworthy. -The constmc-
tion is probably an elliptical dative rather than an ablat. abs.; see nota
ch. 34, 30.

21. tam magna: more emphatic than tanta and comparatively
rare. -With the thought, op. lustin. XI. 1, ita moderate de se muita
pollicitus est, ut adpareret plura eum experimentis reservare, and
Anu. Il. 22, de se nihii addit, metu iltnidiae an ratus conscientiam
sacto satis ease.

Ohapter le. 22. animorum . . .prudsns: weil acquainted nith
tlte temper.

23. docum per aliena experimenta: taapln hp the experience
os others. So Dial.34,16,eruditus . . . alicnis experimentis. For
the meaning ot experimentum, see note ch. 16, 24.

24. excidere: remove, eradicate. Cp. Cic. de prou. carreni. 18,
43, tristissimum tempus . . . eu animo . . . excidere. Surgical
or medical metaphora are comparatively rare in Tacitus and else-
where in Latin, except in Cicero, who had a peculiar fondness ior
them.

27. mhss, etc: sc. apere. Such ellipses oi a verb of doing or
acting, though not unusual, are particularly frequent in Tacitus. cp.
Introd. p. xxxi. publicas rel: public business. So again Germ.
13, 30. ln this' sense, the adjective must precede, because res pub-
liea always has its restricted politica] meaning, but in other combina-
tions with res in Tacitus, the attribute as a rule follows the noun.
See Introd. p. xxvi.

29. ascire sed optimum . . . putare=asctre sed optimum . ..
ascire quia eum . . . putabat. On the prolepsis, see Introd. p. xxx.

30. exsequi: ie. while he kept himself informed oi everything,
he did not always act upon this knowledge. The word, as shown
by poena below, cannot here signiiy to punish, a meaning, moreover,
not found elsewhere in Tacitus, though common in Livy. With the
statement itseli, cp. Introd. p. xii. 2. ' ·
