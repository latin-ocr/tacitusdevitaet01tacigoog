which the information obtainable must have been scanty,
vagae, and unreliable.¹ In these cases, he has at times
yielded to the temptation to which, as he himself tells us,
both Livy and Rusticus succumbed in their description of
Britain, who quoe nondum comperio eloquentia percoluere
(Agr. ch. 10, 4). The tendency, moreover‚ to formulate a
well-balanced antithesis and to close a chapter with a neatly
turned epigram has occasionally resulted in slight incon-
gruities or unwarranted inferences.

But though the concrete material accumulated in the Ger-
manic must be pronounced eminently trustworthy and
valuable, the same fidelity to ascertainable truth cannot be
claimed for the numerous reflectione, conticeo, feelicps, or
ideuls which Tacitus attributes to the Germans. They are
almost without exception fanciful² and, in at least one
instance,³ horden on the grotesque. But these imaginative
passages are due, partly to the romantio halo with which
Tacitus, as pointed out above, invested the barbarian vaces
of the north, partly to his sincere admiration of praise-
worthy qualities which they actually possessed, but which
he failed to find in the civilized society ot his time. The
very stylistic dress in which these reflections are generally
presented also marks them off'olearly from the strictly
historical information, and hence, so far from deceiving the
reader, these poetical features impert to an otherwise purely
scientific trectise on ethuology and geography that irresist
ible fascination which the (tomento shares with every
consummate work of art.

¹ These passages are especially noteworthy‚ as showing how careful
the author was to give only what he had reason to believe to be genu-

ine and trustworthy, this design being in striking contrast with the ’

naivc credulity and the lach oi discrimination displayed, eg, by Mela,
Pliny, and others.
