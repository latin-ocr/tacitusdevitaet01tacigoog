But even granting that the Germania was under con-
siderably greater obligations to the authors discussed above¹
than the evidence will warrant us in assuming, there still
remains a class of topies, aud they are among the most
valuable and interesting in the entire tremiss, which are
not so much as alluded to in any of our extant sources. I
mean tho subject of Germanic mythology, religious origins,
and ritual. This information must have been based upon
the researches oi some scholar who devoted special atten-
tion to topica oi this kind, and it is, therefore, not without
significante that Tacitus, particularly in these chapters,
repeatedly refers, contrary to his usual reticence, to some
previous authority.² Cau his identity be discovered?

Posidonius—Although the supposition does not admit
of positive proof, numerous indicatione clearly point to
the Stoic Posidonius of Apamea as one oi the director
indirect sources of the Germanic.

This consummate scholar, the last and, next to Aristotle,

perhaps the most encyclopaedic investigator in antiquity,

11have designedly omitted the celebrated map oi the world by
Agrippa, for ii it be true that Strabo, Mela, Pliny, Ptolemaeus, and
others made an extensive use oi it, Tacitus cannot also have followed
it, as the irreconcilable divergeuces in the names oi tribes is sufficient
to prove. Maps were very generally accessible at a comparatively
early date, as is clear irom the way one such is spoken oi in Prop.

followed the διόρθωσις τοῦ ’γεωγραφικοΰ πίνακος, the elaborate work oi
Marinus oi Tyre, a contemporary geographer oi distinction. Cp.

According to a method of citation much in vogue among the ancients,
the plurale, like ἔνιοι, φασί, and the like, in Greek, do not necessarily
imply more than one writer, the plural number being oiteu due to the
authorities cited in the source directly consultui.
