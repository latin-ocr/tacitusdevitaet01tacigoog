IV. POETICAL AND FIGURATIVE uuATURus„

As already remarked, the two authors who exerted the
greatest influenee upon the style and vocabulary 61 Tacitus
616 Vergil and Sallust; but, indisputable as this is, we must
guard against the temptation of regarding 611 striking par-
allelisms as so many direct renriniseenoes. Many Vergilian
phrases, and the same is true 61 Sallust, had, by the time
Tanitus composed the Agricola, beoome common property.
In 1661, 11 1116 prose 61 1116 postAugustan age be distin·
guished from the Ciceronian period by one feature more
than another, it is its profound indebtedness to the language
61 the poete,l Livy, whose phraseology is also under heavy
obligations* to Vergil, standing at the threshold 61 this
movement. In the following some 61 1116 more noteworthy
61 the stylistie parallelisrns between Tacitus and earlier
writers, pointed out in the Notes, are briefly summarized:
