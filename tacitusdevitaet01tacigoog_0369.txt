meaning niy'e, woman, or queen). In Alired the Great's Ονοοιιιι, it
is said that Suiones regnant arone ad terram seminarum, and Adam
oi Bremen, doubtless identiiying, albeit erroneously‚ Aestland with
the land oi the Aestii, tells us that it was situated terrae sentinarum
maxima, and inhabited by a racc ol Amazona, concerning whom he
relatas many fabuloua tales. In view of this ignorance‚ as late as the
llth century, Tacitus' simple statement shows a commendable seli-
restraint. The Sitones were unquestionably Finns, not Germana, but

Tacitus restricta the latter to the mainland. continuantur: sallon Ι

on Πεύκη (Piae), an island in the lower Danube. They were a mere
braneh of the Bastarnae, but their Germanic character was unjustly
regarded as doubtful. Cp. Strabo (ie. Polybius 2) Vll. 3, 17, σχεδόν

in 179 n.c., induced them to aid him in his war against the Romaus;
buthe died before anything could be accomplished. Under their
leader, Clondicus, they offered to turnish 20,000 men ιο his successor,
Perseus, but the latter alienated them by his parsimony. Their cus-
toms and manners were accurately described by Polybius, the chiei
source oi later writers. All that we know oi this warlike, populous
race stamps them as Germane, and Tacitus’ passing doubt is based
only on one observation which, even ii true, need not have been gen-
