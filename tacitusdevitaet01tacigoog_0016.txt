proconsul of Asia, as we learn from an inscription.¹ The
date of his death is altogether unknown, but it cannot have
been earlier than 116 an, as may be inferred from an allu-
sion to the conquests of Trajan.²

Writings.—Ii we except the youthful but brilliant Dio·
logos and numerous speeohes which the distinguished orator

doubtless pnblished from time to time, according to the
prevailing custom, Tacitus's illustrious career as a writer
begins with the Agricola, which appeared shortly after the
de'ath of Nerva (J an. 27, 98 an), although the entire work,
with the exception oi the prooemium (1-3) and one passage
at the close,s may well have been composed immediately
alter the death of Domitian.

In the same year there followed the Germanic, the date
being fixed by ch. 37, 5 ff. oi that work.

The Historias, announced as in contemplation in the Apri·
colo (ch. 3, 28-30), appeared between 105-109. They com-
prised the story ol the reigns of Galba, Otho, Vitellius,
Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian, but only the first four
books and a fragment oi the fifth, dealing with the year
(te-ve, have survived.
¹ The Accola began with the death of Augustus, and con-
cluded with the assassination of Nero in 68 ao. Only
bks. I.-,lV., portione of V. and VI, and bks. XL-XVI. are
preserved, the entire narrative of the reign of Caligula,
the beginning of that of Claudius, and the end of Nero’s
being lost.
