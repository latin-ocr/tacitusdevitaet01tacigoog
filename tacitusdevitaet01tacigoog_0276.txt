matio close oi the chapter is a favorite device of Tacitus, but particu-
lsrly conspicuous in this trectise. Cp. Introd. p. lxiv.

Chapter 10. 6· Auspicia sortisque: the generis term is defined

by the more particular. Cp. Intrcd. p. lxviii. utqui maxime ob-
servant = obsetuont ut ii qui maxime observent. A common elliptioal
expression, eg. Liv. V. 25, 9, but in Tacitus only here. The iaot
itscli is abundantly confirmed. Cp. eg. Caes. B. G. I. 50, 4; Arum.
Marc. X1V. 10, 9.

7. simplex: perform, in contrast to the Romans, who hed several
methods oi casting lots. irngiierae arbori: probably the apple
tree and acorn-bearing trees, such as tire oek, and especially the beech
(cp. Engl. bools, Germ. buch). Later, however, also the willow was
used.

Germ. los, meaning something broken cii. notis: this is the
earliest mention eirenes, ior noto is a technical term ior a letter
ln Latin. They numbered originally 16 ideograms and constituted a
kind ol hieratio alphabet. Tbe Roman letters, which were doubtless
known to the Germans from an early time through coine, seem not to
have been ln general use before tbe td century Ab.

9. candidam vestem: white was the prerequisite color in ell
religious ritual, as symbolioal of purity. Cp. Plato, de lep. XII. p.

temere ao fortuito: without order ond nt hcplrozcrd. This end
similar synonymis collocatione are very frequent. As here, eg. Cic.
Tusc. I. 49‚118; Orat. 55, 186; deoff. Ῑ.29,103. spargunt:
poetioal and postAugustan for dispergunt, dissipant. Cp. Verg. Aen.

10. Mox: thereupon, subsequently. Scenotech.2,15. el
publice consulitur: isthe auspices ore to be taken in a ntotter of
public concern. Oonsutere is the von proprio ior augury. For the
indicative, where the subjunctive of repeated action would be more
usual, sce eg. ch. ll, 14. sacerdos civitatis: probably the oldest
priest in the tribal community. Originally doubtless the princeps
exercised the priestly iunction as well, es eg. in Homeris society.
See also note ch. 43, 25.
