8. λιιᾱοιιηπο. . . conmercia refers to the nefarious practice oi
informem, so frequently deneunced by Tacitus, eg. Aah. IV. 30,
delatores, gerrae homiaem publico exitio repertam.

Ohapter 3. 12. et quamquamquamquam actem. Soch. 36,
11,-4444444444 with the subjunctive occurs sixty times in Tacitus,
totwenty instantes with the indicative. · ,, ·

1³. primo statim. . .ortu: ot the very capranica osche down.
Primo statim occurs repeatedly in Tacitus. For the extremely oom-
mon pleonasm with words denoting a beginning, see note Dicl. 11, 18. ’
Nerva Caesar: The references to Trajan, below and 44, 6, imply
the death of Nerva (Jan. 27, 98 mn). Dicas was probably omitted,
because the official consecration had not yet taken place.

14. dhsociabllcs= insociabiles (Tac. Aah. IV. 12; XIII. 17)
incompatible ,· in this sense only here and Claud. in Ros. II. 238. The
same negatival force of the prefix is found, eg, in dissimilis, dis-
plicere. principatum ac libertatem: the antithesis seems to have
been a commonplaoe. Cp. Plut. Gotho, 6, aud Tac. Hier. IV. 64, houd

19. lente. . . extinguuntur: an asyndetic antithesis, the adver-
sative particle being, for the sake oi conchenses, generally omitted.
Se eg. ch. 12, t, tarde mitescunt, cito proveniunt. -On the brachylogy
see Introd. p. xm'ii. With the thought cp. Lucret. I. 556.

20. subit: sc. ocimum. Apparently not elsewhere used abso-
lutely in this sense. quippe = enim, so very frequent in Tacitus,
but in anastrophe only here and in the Aeaeis.

22. Quid? sl usually introduces a concrete illustration oi a geu·
eral proposition. cp.1)ral.20,1o. per quindecim annos: ie. the
reign oi Domitian (81-96).
