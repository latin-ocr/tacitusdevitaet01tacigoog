cherish to her dying day, inethe immediately preceding and following
clauses clearly do not allow us to refer vivendum to t'n paeaand
pereundam to in proelio. accipere se: sc. enne. The relative
agrees with only a part ot the composite antecedent (here the last
mentioned), boves and equas being, oi course, excluded as possible
objecta to be handed down to future generations. On this usage,
cp. note ch. 2, 33 and lor an English example, see Hue's Traoels in
Tletbet 11. 99, lbra and gold witich they collect from tlte dael estleia·
rivere.

4. inviolata ac digna reddat: totietate mtytt hored ocer antar-
nisbed to lter children and render· worthy espessiny to lter daughters-in-
loto, hy them ta turn to be tequeatted to tltet'r descendants. The
verb is best taken ἀπὸ κοινοῦ with inviolata and dtynn pace . . . ccct-
piant. Nnrns, the daughters-in-law, would receive the weapons from
their husbands, in conformity with the statement in l. 26. The omis-
sion ot any mention oi her own daughters as recipiente of arms is
noteworthy; partly because liberte is thus confined to the meaning ot
sona, partly because l. 21 t. impliee that the daughters were not
excluded from this inheritance. The incongruity is due either to a
striving ior rhetorical conciseness or to the fact that women were not
generally allowed to inherit. Cp. note to ch. 20, tu. Quae is also
used ἀπὸ κοινοῦ, as the object olacciptant and the subjectat reserantur.
The same construction occurs in Tacitus again, Dial. 8, 16; Ann.
11. 83; and perhaps 1. 16. Itis equally rare elsewhere, eg. Sall. Jeep.
14, 16; 31, 18; 101, b; Liv. XXII. 6, 12; Seu. de tranq. 8, 9.

5. nepotes: either their descendants or ter yrendsons. The former
usage is found only in the poete, occurring first in Catuli. ag. XLIX.
l, thereaiter frequently, but not elsewhere in Tacitus, nor does he
employ the word in the sense oi grandebtldren. Stylistic reasons
favor the first translation, while liberis-sons, may be urged 011 behali
ol the second.

Ohapter 19. 6. Ergo: hence, he. because of this sanctity of the
marriage. So ag. ch. 22, 8, the resumptive force oi the particle
being much the rerer in Tacitus. Cp. note ch. 45, 4. saeptae:
hedyed tn, quarded. With the ohiastic collocation ot saeptae. .. ·
conruptae, placed at the beginning and end to heighten the eontrast,
cp. ch. 14, 29 a, exigant . . . cedrent; 42, 2 ff. praecipua . . . parta.
agunt: lice. See note ch. 17, 6. spectaculorum inlecebrlsz Α
