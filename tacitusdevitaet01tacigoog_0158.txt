27. inertia pro sapientia: with the thought, cp. Hist. 1. 49,
sed cleriter natalium . . . obtentui, ut, qaod sepaitic eret, sapientia
vereretur. In Agricola, however, the conditione were reversed.
idem. . . silentium: the meaning oi this statement, though cor-
rupted in the Mes, is clear. Agricole’s praetorship passed without
any features worthy oi record. The et is epexegetic.

28. iurisdictio: during the limpha, the number of praetore occa-
sionally rose as high as eighteem but only the praetor urbanas and

ie. became nearer to acquiring distinction iu this matter than oue
would have expected, because reckless extravagance iu iurnishing
amusement to the people was the time-honored method oi gaining
popularity. The statement iurnishes a good illustration oi Tacitus's
skill in tuming-tc his hero’s credit what was at best an indifferent
periormance.

Pege 5. 1. dona, etat probably this refers to temple property
cmmed away by private individuals during the great fire under Nero,
who had himself replenished his own losses by depletiug the temples
throughout the empire oi their art treasures, These latter were now
beyond restitution, but the others were collected with such success
that the commouwealth no more ielt their absence than ii they had
reverbeeuremoved. This idea is implied iu the pluperieot. Fora
