deliberately selected so 100101ι and ludicrously inadequate
a paragraph as this for imitation is like maintaining that
a Kiepert or a Mommsen consulted a school geography
or history. There is, moreover, very little in this chapter ‘
to correspond to the account of Tacitus, the similar iterus
of information being of the most commonplace character
and partly found in Caesar.

Under these circumstances, it is quite superfluous to
discuss at any length the alleged stylistic influence of Mela
upon Tacitus. Suffice it to say that the verbal coincidences
so zealously collected,² either do not pertain to the same
topics or were unavoidable, many expressions belonging to
the common vocabulary of the language, while in others
the resemblance is imaginary or, at best, extremely faint⁸

Finally, as these fancied reminiscenoes are culled from all

the three books 01 Mela, and not, as one would expect, from
the chapter on Germany alone, it would logically follow that
one of the greatest stylistic artists in the world’s literature

1Fully one-half of it is, moreover‚ taken up with a bald enumera·
tion of the foreste, swamps‚ and rivers 01 Germany‚ together with a
description of the sicus Codanus in which scandinavia is supposed to
be located.

8Το substantiate this charge, it will suffice merely to select ot
random a few out of many phrases of Mela, more or less closely
paralleled in the Germanic, all of which have been seriously adduced
to establish Tacitean indebtedness: sapum (cp. 17, 4); mopuc cx
porte siluis 00 paludibus tuoto (5, 14); inritam feritatem (43, 1);
adsuetudine laborum mouture frigoris (4,12); nuda· ayunt (20, 24);
