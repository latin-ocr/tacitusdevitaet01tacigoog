m rnusrwourmunss OF THE cunum.

The trustw0rthiness of the varied and extensive informa· ·
tion imparted in the Germanicis directly conditioned by
the nature of the sources consulted. That these comprised
the very best available in the author's time can admit of no
question, but the following consideratione may serve to con·
firm the highly anthentic character of this treatise.

In tho first place, we meet with scarcely a single stute-
ment offert which can be said to be irrleerenrly improbable
or t'ucredible.l The significance of this observation will
be appreciated at its proper value, if we compare the
accounts in Strabo, Diodorus, Mela, Pliny, and even Caesam
for these abound in numerous details which every modern
reader will at once recognize as fabulous, grotesque, cr im·
possible.

In the second place, it may bc asserted, without qualifi-
cation, that Tacitus has not been convicted of a solitura
misstotement, where he might or must hone known better. Not
that this treatise is faultless3 on the contrary, it contains
many items of information which modern scholarship must

reject or, at least, modify; but in every instance the error
is due to well-recognizable causes. The passage is either
obscure and misleading, owing to a desire for extreme con-
ciseness oi expression, or else Tacitus deals with topice on

able number ol passages on Germanic geography and ethnology, it was
strangely, butwithout exceptionpersistently,ignored by Roman writers.

¹There are a few details which might make this impressiou, but
while Tacitus did not aare to omit them altogether, he himself ex-
presses his doubts as to their authenticity. Cp, ch. 2, 8: 3, 1 n.;
