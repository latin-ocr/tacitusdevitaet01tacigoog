15. δὼς a non-Germanic tribe, as is clear from eh.43,13. Of
the alternatives here offered, only the first hypothesis is ethnologicaliy
acceptabis. The Osi, possibly by agreement, remained in their terri-
tory while their kinsrnen, the Aravisci, crossed the Danube, the
departure being probably due to over-population. A similar cause for
the migration oi certain Gallie tribes is given by Liv. V. 34, 3, but this
plausible solution of the problem did not occur to 'Tacitus or his
authorities, astho following cnm clause shows.

16. eodem . . . moribus: isdem must be supplied with the
plural's out of eodeni. The order in which these criteria are given is the
usual one iu Tacitus. cp. ch. 43, 13 ; 46, 3; Hist. II. 37 ; III. 33. The
asyndeton givesacumuiative effectio the argument. SeeIntrodp. lxvii.

18. pari . . . inopia ac libertate: the argument is far from con-

(Β. G. II. 4, 1), Strabo (IV. 3, 4 p. 194), aad Appian (Hist. Rom.
1v. l, 4) make thern out to be Germane, and the Belgians generally
claimed a Germanic origin, which Tacitus, however, with a touch of
sarcasm, rejects, as the expressions adfectationem, nitro, ambitt'osi,
