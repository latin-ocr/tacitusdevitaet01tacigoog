of further aggressive campaigns, by showing what formi-
dable and invincible enemies these Germano had been in the
past. It thus constituted, though only by shrewd implica
tion, the very key-note of the treatise. But if so, the inser·
tion of this passage was singularly tactless and insulting, in
that the author would hare depreciated the ability of so great
a general, as Trajan admittedly was, to eope successfully
with these foes, on the ground that all his predecessore had
ignominously failed. Again, in apolitioal pamphlet, de-
signed lor the immediate present, the statement that it was
written in the second consulship of Trajan would be as gra =
tuitous as if an American pamphleteer today, in an article
written lor the American public, were to tell his readers
that the Philippine insurrection occurred during the third
year of McKinley's administration. In a scientific mono
graph, however, elaborated into awork ol literary art and as
such intended for postmity, the chronological data referred
to are eminently proper. The entire chapter was, moreover,
so manifestly suggested by the incidental mention of the
Cimbri, once so powerful but now so insignificant, that the
assumption of any ulterior purpose forits insertion is in no
way justified.

Finally‚ the very style of the Gemanica precludes its
having ever been intended as a political pamphlet, for this
imperatively called for a distinctively oratorical treatment,
belonging, as it did, to what the ancient rhetoricians term
the λόγος ψόγου, the opposite of the encomium.¹

We must, therefore, conclude that the treatise de criptae,

¹Many have taken refuge in a kind of compromise, and speak ot
an ethico-political trectise, but this, apart from being open to the
objections pointed out above, is quite incompatible ,with the as-
sumption tlrat its author was a practical statesman who wrote tor
contemporaries in support of a definite policy. Tacitus was not a
philosophiam rhetorician and political theorist like Isocrates.
