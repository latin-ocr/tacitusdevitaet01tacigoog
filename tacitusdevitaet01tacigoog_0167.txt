17. adfirmavit: confirmed ‚· ior that Britain isan island hed been
asserted by Pytheas and others, but Agricola's fleat first demonstrcted
it. It is to this achievement that the only ancient author, besides
Tacitus, who mentions Agricola, refers. cp. Dio Cass. LXVI. 20.

18. Orcadas: ie. the Orlrneys. That they were wholly unknown
up ιο this time, as Tacitus states, is disproved by Mela and Pliny. -
The Greek accusative plural occurs in Tacitus bnt rarely and only iu
proper names. Cp. Germ. 45; Hist. IV. ὄις Ana. III. 61; IV. 51;
Xll. 32, 33, 38; XIV. 29.

19. Dispecta: was descricd in tlte distance, but, unlilre the Ork-
neys, Thule was not subdued, because they had no orders to do so,
and even ii they had, the approaching winter would have made it
inexpedient ιο attempt its subjugarim, the tacit assumption being that
the Romans would have had no difficulty in accomplishing the task. -
The verb at the beginning, and attha same time in juxtaposition with
domuit, skiiliully emphasizes the antithesis. Thule: first mentioned
hythe distinguished navigator, Pytheos oi Massilia (lth cent. n.o.),
and regarded by the ancients generally as the most northerly point oi
' the earth, hence altimo Tltale (Verg. Georp. 130). It was said by
Pytheas to be six days' sail from Britain, the night and day being six
months long. Hence it has been rashly identified by some with Ice-
land. The island here referred to was probably Mainland, the largest
of the Shetland group. It can be seen from the Orkneys. hac·
tenus: sc. progredi, to cdoanoe up to this point only, with special
reference to dispecto est. Their orders were to return, so soon as
Thule was sighted. The omission oi teritum ls a noteworthy Latin
idiom. et = et praeterea. In this treatise again ch. 11, 5; 15, 3ος
26, 17 ; 29, 24 ; 30, 27 ; 31, 2ος 38, 26. So also ac (l. asp-The date
(83 mo.) as well as the season oi the year is fixed by ch. 38, 29.

20. mare pigrum: corresponds to the πεπηγυῖα θάλασσα oi
Pytheas, the mare concretam oi Pliny, and may represent the aeas
of the northern ocean filled with floating messes of ioe in which an-
cient mariners may ¹well have found it difficolt to make any hcadway.
In the Germ. 45, 25 the ocean west oi scandinavia is similarly styled
neore piorum oc prope inmotum. As we see irom this description, the
knowledge ol these regions had been but little advanced in the iour
centurias that separate Tacitus irom Pytheas. -On the brachylogy in
this clause, cp. Iatrod. p. xxxiii. perinde: so. uc cetero mario, an
elliptical comparison common with perinde, aeque, and the like. This
sluggish sea is not stirred like other sheets ol water even ina storm.
