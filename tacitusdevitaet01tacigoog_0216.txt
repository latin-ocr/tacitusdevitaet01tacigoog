111111] nores. onerans 61, 129

aliquando . . . virtusque: sc. redit, as shown by Tacitus’s model,
Verg. Aea. 11. 361, ostendam etiem victis redit 16Ι praecordio 611166.
Cp. also Sen. Trood. 6111, inermes offeram monus Dabit iro eires,
with the same antithesis as 1111129 i.

Paga 25. 1. adpropinquaverunt: sc. Britanni, easily supplied
from the preceding oletis, and made necessary by the context. iden-
tidem: to be taken with conlecti, ie. on approaching the foresta, the
Britons repeatedly rallied.

2. primos sequentium incautos: ie. those Roman soldiers who
festinatione victoriae incautiously followed the fleeing enemy in ad·
vance of the pursuing cohorte, the Britons‚ etc. —The irregular word-
order was caused by a desire ior succinet and rhythmical expression.
-On the use of the adjective (incautos) for the adverb, see note ch,
b, 2. The entire passage closely resembles Liv. XXII. 31, 4.

3. frequens ubique: who was everywhere wosnicuoasly oenoe.-
The phrase is pleonasde, for the sake of emphasis. Cp. note ch.
22, 16.

4. indaginis modo: aster tte brunner os o cordon. The figure is
taken from hunting, the wild beasts being driven into one spot and
surrounded by nets. Cp. Verg. Aea. IV. 121. The simile is very ire-
quently applied to the enclosing oi enemies, eg. Liv. Vll. 37, 11. ,

6. persultare: to secar, roam over. Here, as also elsewhere in
Tacitus, the verb is used in a more general sense, and therefore appli-
cabletoiniantryaswell. acceptum aliquod. . . fiduciam foret:
the participle is unusually far removed from its anxiliny, probably
here for the purpose of securing alliterative groups. Cp. also Lucret
I. 16; Tac. Aac. XII. 16, coepto . . . soret.

7. virinus: domnae. This figurative sense of volnus, especially
frequent with occipere, is a euphemism for eludes. In Tac. again,
Aen. IL 21.

8. compositos . . . ordinibus: ie. when it was seen that the
Romans had recovered irom the confusion into which they had been
thrown, and were again pursuing in battle array, etc.

9. verslzse uerterunt. See note oh. 18, 20. allus alium
respectantes = 16 vicem r. The phrase, also with the plural verb,
is found in Sall. Hier. froom. (Speech of Lepidus) 1. 41,20 D, alias
olium prinoipem expectantes, and the construction is quite common in
Livy. In Tacitus only here, and used to avoid the repetition oi
incitem or inter se.
