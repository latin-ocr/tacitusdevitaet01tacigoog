N this revised edition many changes and additions have been
made, rendering the book, without question, the best·

equipped text of Caesar's Gallie War published for school use.

The Introduction and Notes have been rewritten, the Vocab-
ulary enlarged, a Key to the English Pronunciation of Proper
Names added, several plans replaced, and the Table of idioms,
so valuable to beginners for drill on syntax is retained. The
Notes have references to Bennett, Allen and Greeuough, and
Harkness (Complete Edition).

The Text has been reprinted from new plates which are cast
from type larger than that used in the old book. The most
important change in this new edition is the marking of the long
vowels. This has been done in the belief that ii pupils are
taught to pronounce accurately in the first years os their Latin
reading, and have enough practice in pronouncing, they will
hardly experience difficulty afterward.

Two editions of the Text only, one with and one without
marked quantities, have been prepared, and either of these will
be furnished free to schools using the book.

Dr, Richard Μ. Jones, Hem-Masta William Penn CharterSclrool, Phila-
delphia, Pa. .· 1 congratulare you, as the first in this country to embody the
modern idea oi a school edition of Caesar, upon your pluck in determin-
ing to retain your place at the head ot the Caesar column, and upon the
resources and enterprise which will enable you to stay there. I have,
therefore, taken great pleasure in placing the book upon our order list for
next autumn.

James B. Smiley, West Higk School, Cleveland, 0. .· In its revised form,
Kelsey's Caesar seems to me to be the best edition which we have. The
typography is excellent and the marking oi long vowels is an added im-
provemeut.
