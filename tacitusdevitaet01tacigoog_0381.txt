as usual iu this treatise, marks the close of a chapter.

is, however, equally probable that sama vera represents the origittal,
the et being, in that case, due to scripturo continue (usquesamo); ai

45, 14. ut barbaris may be plausibly explained as in note ad loc.,
or with ellipsis of 1110111011, but possibly Tacitus wrote ut ia barcae-ta

passage has given rise.

Wolff, have placed the words Suionibus-degenerant after ch. 44, 24.
The reasoning which prompted so bold a conjecture has been reiuted
by I. F. Maroks, Festschr. zur 43. Versommi. deutsch. Piu'toi. zu utic,
1896, p. 11711, but the transposition 11 equally untenablo on external
grounds. (1) It is paleographically out oi the question. (2) Chapter
44 already closes with an epigram ; 011 the other hand, it 11 1101
probable.that the entire descrIption 01 Suebia from ch. 38-44, would

have ended without one. (3) Such atransposition must consisteutly .

iuclude the clause Hic Suebiae fluia, but this would be absurd after
011. 44, 24, as the Suebic Aestii are subsequently dlecussed‚ and at the
same time ch. 46 would open too abruptly, without any hint behtg
given that the following tribes are non-Suebic. (4) Hic Suebiae fluia
cannot follow directly upon the close oi a non-geographical excursus.
(5) Andfinally, the advocates 01 the transposition are compelled 10
change Suiones (ch. 41, 25) to Sitones, aprocedure of itself sufficient
10 vindicate the MS. tradition.

placed at the close oi the long account of the Suebi.
