present happy age, and he prophetically ioretoid the accession oi
Trajan to the throne. 'irajan's achievements in Germany before
91 nn, the year ci his consulship, had drawn attention to him, as in
the similar case ot Vespasian (ch. 13, 28 ii.) and his future greatness
seems ιο have been generally predicted. Cp. Plin. Ponep. 5, 94 ; Dio
Cass. LXVII. 12, 1. The involved structure oi the sentence was due
ιο the author’s striving after concisenees.

7. apud noemae auris: in my presence. An instance oi synec-
doche. This particular quasi-personification occurs in iour other
Tacitean passages, viz. Hist. I. 263 Ann. 1. 313 ΙΙ. 39 ; IV. 29, but
apparently not elsewhere. eminebatur = separabatur et ccide
optabat. An instance ot the eo-called constructio praegnans. Cp.
Introd. p. xxxiii festinatae mortis: objectiva genitive. The
passive meaning is first found in Sallust, eg. Iup. 64, 6; with the
implication oi prematurely inflicted death, ag. Juv. iv. 95 i, mors
...festinata

8. masse: sc. enm, is the subiect ot solacium tulit, sc. nohis, as
contrasted with sient ei (l. 5).

9. spiramenta: in this figurative sense the word occurs only here
and in Tacitus's imitator, Amm. Marcell. XXIX. 1, 40, who substitutos
mora tor intercailc; XIV. 7, 15.

10. continuo et velut uno ictu: ie. hlows dealt out so un-
ceasingly as to amount to but a single stroke. continno is not used
as an adverb hy Tacitus, hut may be conveniently translated as such
here.

11. exhaumt = persedit; merely a strengthened torm oi haurire
which is very citen used in this sense. Cp. eg. Claud. Quadrig. apud
Geli. N. A. IX. 13, 17; Lucret. V. 1322; Liv. VII. 10, 10, uno citero-
qce subinde ictu ventrem orqrn inguina hansit; Tac. Hist. 1. 41,
iuynlnrn eins locasse. -The other, generally accepted meaning, to
drinio np the blood, sep the strength of, though still more common both
in the simple and compound verb, would unnecessarily introduce a
mixed metaphor.

¹ chapter 45. 12. Non vidit, etc: such passages are typical of
rhetorical consolationes, a species ci composition much cultivated in
ancient literature. Cp. Cic. de orat. ΙΙΙ. 2, 8, non cidit (sc. Crassus)
, flagrantem hello Italiam . . . non sceleris nefarii principes cic-itatis
reos . . . non esiliam penori, non . . . 0. Meri ‚lapan . . non
iiiam . . . caedem omninno crudelissimam, etc. Sulpicius in Cic.
