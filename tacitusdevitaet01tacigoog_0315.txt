de re rust. I. 9, but apparently not elsewhere.

29. venire: to besold. ln re prava: ina vicione proceedinp.
pervicacia: stabbornness, obstinncy.

30. iidem: bonor. This Tacitus regarded as an abuse of the
terminares provo. condicionis: close, kind. per conmercia
tradunt: they dispose os through tie medium os trude, ie. by ex-
changing these slaves ior desirable commodities. The Germanic slave
trade mentioned by Caes. B. a. IV. 2, l pertains only ιο prisoners
oiwar.

sl. aequoque, etc: this isa ianciiul explanation oi Tacitae,
prompted, as usual, by the desire to give a rhetorical or epigram-
matic close ιο a chapter. In consequence, he has involved himself in
incongruities ; ior, as fidem shows, the loser's voluntary servitude would
not have bean considered a disgrace, while the winner’s action cannot
well have been due to a feeling oi shame, buthe probably had reason
ιο iear trouble on the part oi the unfortunate gambler's relativae, in
case he retained the man as a slave in his own household. Again,
although pudor, as indicated by qnoque, is predicated oi both loser
and winner, its attributlve genitive (victorine) is applicable only ιο the

represent the real condition oi affairs. But to attempt ιο reconcile the
author with our equally vague iniornration, as has so oiten been done,
is an idle and useless task. Ι
’ 32. ceterum: specleinp generally, slaves, etc.; here a resumptive
particle. Cp. note ch. 2, ll. servis: as a slave could nat hold
property, and, as he is here compared with a Roman colonus, Tacitus
or his sources seem to have confused the serf proper (ior it is to him
that the words verberare . . . impune esi apply) with the so-called
