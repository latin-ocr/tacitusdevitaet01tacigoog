24. religionis: rite. Cp. note ch. 39, 12. Praesidet: se.
reticioni; tolree charge os the ceremony.

2⁵. mullebri ornatu: probably the priest was clad in a long robe
and wore thicher hair like women ; at least the Hoediaye, the name oi
the Vandilian royal family, means mea reith wonvorr’e hair, and the
king, as in all primitive society, also exercised priestly iunctione. cp.
note ch. 10, 10.

26. Castorem Pollucemque: the worship oi the twin brothers,
¹or Dioscuri, is Indo-European, and the interpretatio Romana (or
rather Graeco) is here not merely based upon occidental similarities
in ritual, as in ch. 3, 17 ; 9, 29, ior the cults were originally identical,
hut thie waS, oi course, unknown to the Romen antiquarians. Ee
vie nemim: eorum (sc. Castoris Peliacisque) cie haic quoque nu·
mirri ‚· he. their characteristics belong to this Germanic divinity.

2⁷. Alcis: probably dative, by way of symmetry with numini ,¹ cp.
note ch. 16, 30, and Critical Appendirr, ch. 36, 20. With vocabalum,

keeping with the statement in ch. 9, 2 ii. peregrinae supereti-
tlonle: i.e. non-Germanic worship, the designation superstitio imply-
ing that this cult, unlike that oi Isis, was not regarded as having been
importcd. Cp. note ch. 9, 29 i. The entire passage shows that
Tacitus or hie authorities, while inclined to recognize the identity oi
the German and Roman deities, were sorely puzzled at not finding the
concrete evidence in support oi it, by which they elsewhere established
their mythological parallelisms.

28. Ceterum Harii: bat to return to tlte Harii. On thie resump-
tive force oi the particle, cp. note ch. 2, 11.

29. cuper: orer aad abore. Cp. note ch. 30, 4. paulo ante

tentpore pugnandi deligendo, viz. atrae . . . noctis.

2. lenocinantur: cdd to, cohaere. ln this weakened, figurative
sense the verb is post-Augustam In Tacitus again, Dici. 6, 27.
nigre acute: on the coloring ei shielde, see note ch. 6, 12. tincta
