it is, therefore, equivalent to aeque focile, not: facilius ; but this
involves an irreconcilable contradiction with ch. tt, 7. 24. (l) It is
psychologically incredible that a man of Tacitus' rank, insight, and
disposition should have seriously advised his countrymen that the best
way ιο subdue their old enemy would be to start a beer brewery, with
aview to dispensing the German beveragc free of cost, and in unlimited
quantities, implyIng at the same time that the Germane would gladly
have accepted it, as not being supplied already with quantam con·
capiscuna asurmisa flatly contradictcd by ch. 22. Moreover, this
grotesque and absurdly impracticable scheme constitutas the onia
policy which the great historiam ventured to suggest in the entire
treatlse —a treatise which many scholare, albeit erroneously‚ regard
as a political pamphlet, primarily designed for Trajan aud directed
against Roman jingoesl (b) Finally the pointed phrase, haud. . .
vincentur, is, quite unlike the numerous other epigrammatic expressions
of this author, not only utterly inappropriate‚ because demonstrably
false, but it also bears a suspicions resemblance ιο Justln 1. 8, l, priua

ever, in perfect keeping with the context aud not open to any oi the
obiections above referred to; but Tacitus was notin the habit of

at a time when triumphati mepta paam victi (ch. 37, 24) had ceased
to be applicable ιο the Germana, ie. about the oth century an.

ceteris, for the servi condicionis haiae, with which it is contrasted‚

25, 32. discriptis] descriptis-MSS. No reliance can be placed
upon the MSS. in the orthography of compounds with cb· or de, but
describere militatert'a officio, res, and the like seems to have been the
standard usage.

25, 4. Ch. 15, 8 f. 20, 24 if, render it extremely doubtful whether
children, ie. before the fifteenth year, when they were invested wlth
arms (cp. ch: 13, 31 li), would be called upon to do household dutiae
Iam, therefore, strongly inclined to believe that Tacitus wrote liberti.
This would also at once account for the statement made immediately
below, liberti aon militnm snpra seinos sant, for Tacitus had pre-
