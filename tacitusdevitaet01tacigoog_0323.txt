latter being included in the former, but added epexegetically. Cp.
Hist. V. t; Ann. XVI. 28 ; and Introd. p. lxviii.

3. quatenus: in sofar as. The word is used in its original local
meaning in ch. 42, ὃ, but elsewhere in Tacitus in the sense oi qnoniam.

4. Galliae: i.e. Oalltasupera'orandiaseriar. expediam: aar·-
rabo. A poetic word, found in this sense as early aa Ter. Ena. IV.
4, 27 (vs. 694), frequently in Vergil, and in prose first in Sall. Jny. h,
3. In Tacitus again, ag. Ana. IV. 1, nanc originem, mores . . .

Ohapter 28. ⁵. Validiores. . . res: sc. quana Germanarum.
summus anctorum: :nost rrasraorrny as writers. This laudatory
reference to caesar’s Gallio War is in significant contrast with the ill·
humored disparagement oi Asinius Pollio. Cp. Suet. Iul. 56, param
diligenter paransque integra acritate compositae putat. lt is the only
passage in the Germania in which Tacitus mentions one of his sources
by name, and proves incidentally that such dlscrepancies as exist
are not due, as has been maintained, toa desire to contradict Caesar,
but are simply the result oi the more authentic knowledge acquired
since his time. The allusion is to B. G. VI. 24, i, sarit antea tempas,
cnnr Gernnaaos Galli virtute snper-arent. Cp. also Ayr. 11, 16.

7. Gallos ln Germaniam transgressos: modern ethnology in-
clines to the opinion that a counter migration oi Celts never occurred.

Hence these Galli, on the right bank of the Rhine, must be regarded
as the remnants of the original wandering tribes who did not cross the

river. quantulum, etc: hora small aa obstacle aad a stream effer,
etc. In this sense, the word occurs repeatedlyin'l‘acitns. lt is here
an adverbial accusative.

9. permutaret: interchanye, as ch. ὅ, 29; but the force of the
proposition was no longer strongly felt. Op. Htst. IV. 11, domos
hortosque percantans, and note ch. 24, 28. promiscuas adhuc:
still cananaea property, open to all. Cp. esp. Hist. IV. 63, st promiscua
ea sedes ararathes Gerananr's soret, and ch. 44, 20. On the medial posi-
tion oi aethnaeae Intrad. p. lxvi. et nulia . . . divisa: added to
detine sedes promiscuas more closely. See Intrad. p. lxviii. 011 et
nulia = raeque alla, cp. note ch. 10, 18.

10. regnorum must here be understood in the more general sense
oi established yarernrnents, for none oi the tribes that dwelt near the
Rhine were, even in Tacitus' time, ruled by hingo. potentia:
authority. Igitur: accordingly ,· resumptive aiter a digressiones
