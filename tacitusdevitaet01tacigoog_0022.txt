But while the sections under notice are thus seen to be
justified by rhetorical canons, Tacitus may at the same time
have been led to insert them by still other motives. One
such reason he seems to give himself,¹ still another may
have been the example of Sallust, his great model at this
stage oi his career as awriter, who inserts a similar account
of Africa in the ΙῙιιριινιῙια2 before proceeding to the πράξεις
proper. Finally, this sketch subserves the purpose of
acquainting the reader with the kind of people with whom
a Roman general had to deal and the geographical condi-
tions with which he had tc contend.

The narrative of the πράξεις themselves (ch. 18-42)3 is
again in perfect conformity with the rhetorical norm, being
divided into two parts,⁴ Agricola's military exploits (ch.
18-40, 2) and his life as a private citizen (ch. 40, 3—42),⁶ but

in this part also modern scholare have found much to cen-
