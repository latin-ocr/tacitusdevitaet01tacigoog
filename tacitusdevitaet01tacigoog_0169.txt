82 noras. enarres 11. [Phdhss

transierant. ut: us mipht be expected. This elliptical use oi ot
occurs often in Tacitus, eg. 18, 7; Germ. 1,8; 22, 32; 27, 273 30, 273
45,14.

2. Habitus corporum: physicol characteristico. So 81111148.
ex eo argumenta: sc. petentum-On the ellipsis, cp. lotrad. p. xxxi.

3. rutilae . . . artus: cp. Germ. 4, 9, rutilaecomoe, 1101111001-
poro. —Taeitus's information was probably derived from Agricola,
though he may have seen some oi the natives in Rome.

4. ellurum: they dwelt in what is now South Wales and Mon·
mouthshire, and were subdued by Frontinus. See ch. 17, 14. Their
origin, probably Celtic (see below), is still an unsolved problem oi
ethnology. colorati: usually taken in the sense of awerthe, 1111-
barat, an epithet applied by the ancients to the llindoos‚ Chinese, and
, Etruscans; but such a designation seems quite ont oi place with
respect to a· nation living in northern elimes, and would be incon-t
sistent with their Celtic origin, nor is there any evidence that the
Iberians oi Spain were colorati ,· finally, itis important to observe
that in the rest oi the description oi the Silures, unlike that oi the
Caledoniam, no physica, but only external and acquired characteris·
tias are referred to. lt will, therefore, be best to interpret the epithet
in a like sense here, ie. painted, possibly tattooed‚ which is a well-
ettested practice oi the Britons. Cp. Caes. B. G. V. 14, 2.

5. et = et praeterea, aad tlte sact ororeoeer. See note ch. 10, 19.
On et aiter an asyndeton, see Introd. p. xxviii. '

6. eaeque sedes: the context leaves it undetermlned whether
Tacitus meant to say that Iberians settled in the territory then occu·
pied by the Silures, the latter aequiring Iberian customs, in which
ease the Silures were Celts (ep. the term Celtiberi), or whether the
Silures oi his time were the descendants oi the Iberian conquerors
who drove out the Celtic 'aborigines In either ease the hypothesis oi
the Iberian migration must be rejected.

7. proximi Gallis et similes, eta: ie. the tribes dwelling nearest
to the Gauls (viz. the Cantians) also (et=ett‘am) resemble thern.
The two seu clauses do not give alternative reasons, but the first is
in a measure the direct result oi the proximity, while the similar
climatic conditione account ior the ethnological resemblance. du·
rante originis usu: because tlte castoras of their· eripiant state were
retained. dature in the sense oi to sutelae, seems to occur first in Livy.

8. diversa: ia opposite directions. For the meaning opposite, cp.
eg. eh. 23, 28. positio caeli: climate.
