civilized Rome.

As regards the idealization 01 Germanic traits and cus·
101110,ι it must be observed, not only that it is at best inci-
dental‚ but that a similar attitude is shared by the ancients
generally, who 110111 Homer down have thrown a halo 01 in·
0000000 and rectitude about the remote people 01 the North,
101 distance has always lent enchantment to the view and
00010 pactam pro magnifico. Now to a man like Tacitus
who, dissatisfied with the conditione in which his lot was
cast, longed to dwell in the ‘good old times,' these sturdy,
vigorous Germane naturally came to serve ae aweloomc
background 101 1110 pessimistic reflections. The resultant
contrasts, so disparaging to the society 01 his day, were thus
partly the natural outcome 01 the subjectmatter as such,
partly the reflection 01 those convictione and feelings which
give to all 01 the author’s writings that distinctiva character
and individuality which we designate as Το0110011,2

But while the view maintaining the ethical 01 satirical

purpose 01 the Germania has now been all but universally
abandoned, another hypothesis, though without a scintilla
01 evidence and objectionable on many grounds, has been
and still is tenaciously held by numerous scholars 01 reputo.8
