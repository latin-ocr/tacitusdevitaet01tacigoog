The Historioal aetarnae-5. Σύγκρισις. Immediately
upon the account of the ethnology and geography of Britain
there follows in our treatise a fairly detailed retrospect
concerning the predecessore of Agricola (ch. 13-18), and it,
ton, has been pronounoed out of place in a biography. But

this objection is also unwarranted, for here again Tacitus .

strictly conforme to the rules for the βασιλικὸς λόγος, the
historical surrey being clearly in the nature of a σύγκρισις ¹
or comparison, which is invariably given as an integral
part of the biographical encomium.l And that Tacitus hirn-
self regarded these and the preceding chapters as legitimate
and essential is indicated by ch. 18, 17, huuc Brdtoonicc
simum, hos bellorum vices Agricola . . . incenit, with which
words he introduces the πράξεις ἐν πολέμῳ of his herc.

The σύγκρισις is preferably made to follow tho πράξεις and
is placed immediately before the ἐπίλογος,1 but its position
was not definitely fixed³ and Tacitus was therefore perfeotly
at liberty to insert it where he chose, without violating
any rhetorical standards. With that keen eye for effec-
· tire dramatic grouping which distinguishes him above all

among ancient historians took the greatest pains in regard to the
topography and strategio movements of a battle, ,do not wholly satisfy
modern standards of accuracy and clearness, for they, too, occasionally
succumbed to the temptation of rhetorical crnbellishment.
