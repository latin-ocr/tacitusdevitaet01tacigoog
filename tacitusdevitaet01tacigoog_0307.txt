atlon, for the Werpeld of a noble was usually twice that ol an ordinary
freeman. Cp. note ch. 12, 23. Originally, all cases oi homicide called
for blood vengeance, but with the emergente from primitive conditione,
in Tacitus’ time, satisfactio or compositio came to be regarded as an
adequate substitute, and, ii agreed to by the culprit's relatives, the
elan to which the murdered man belonged would be morally pledged
to discontinue the send. The motive here given for this more humane
practice does not, oi course, represent the actual reasoning oi the
Germane (cp. note ch. 7, ii), but was a natural result oi adereluping
civilizution. An explanation analogous to thet oi Tacitus is, however,
offered by Lucretius (V. 114541.) lor a slmilar change. armento·

see notes ch. 5, 16. 17.

14. utiliter ln publicum sc. boc Jit, eprocedure ⁰s advantage to
tlte communitp. With the phrase, cp. biv. IV. 6, 2, utiliter inpraesenti
certamen respondit. As the clause is in apposition to recipit . . .
donnus, we should expect utile, a benefit to, in accordante with a well·
attested Tacitean usage. Cp. eg. Hist. I. 44, omoeoque . . . interfici
iussit. . . munimentum adpraesens.

1⁵. iuxta libertatem: in proportiove to tlte liberty enjoyed. For
other peculiar uses oi this preposition, apparently confined to Tacitus,
cp. ch. 30, 8, and Diui. 22, 2.

16. convictibus et hospltlls: seusts amouy themselves and euter-
tuinments of strunyers. The latter are discussed first, while the two
following chapters deal with the former. eliuslue indulget: is
more immoderately oddicted. cp. Hist. Ι. 19, effusius furere.

17. Quemcumque mortalium, etc: op. Caes. B. G. VI. 23, 9,
hospitem uiolare sas uon putenm qui persicumque de causa ud eos
uenerunt, ab iniuria probibent sanctosque putant. The rights of
hospitality are rigidly observed among primitive peoples and in newly
settled, isolated communium, the custom being primarily due to seli-
interest. It is doubtful, however, whether the Gemens extended
the same comtesy to non-Germanic peoples. The Roman attitude
is best reflected in the word hostis, which origInally stood ior both
strouper (cp. our host, Germ. past) and enemy. Monetium, a
more emphatic term than homines, was first introduced into prose
by Sallust.

18. pro tortuna: socordior to his means. So again, Anu. XIV.
