17. Igitun icitur st the beginning of a sentence is the rule in
Tacitus. One oi the suen exceptione occurs ch. 10, 20. This par·

shadowed by the last clause, dorniti, etc. primus, etc: i.e. in 55
and 54 ac.

20. ostendisse . . . tradidisse: Caesar's expeditioris to Britain,
on the whole, proved unsuccessiul, and he is, therefore, said merely

emperors were not deified aiter death. praeceptum: cp. Tac.
Anu. I. 77, neque sas Tiberio tantopere dioto eius (sc. Auyusti), and
esp. IV. 31, qui omnia facta dictaque cius (sc. Aupusti) uice teon
