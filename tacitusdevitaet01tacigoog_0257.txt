would have been too emphatic here. Cp. Theocr. XVI. 4, βροτοὶ
οἵδε.

28. Asciburgium: mentioned also in Tac. Hist. IV. 33 as a mili·
tary station on the lower Rhine, the modern Asberg. See map.
hodieque = hodie qaoque, still te this day. Cp. Dial. 35, 25. Situm
is the participle.

29. nominatumque: the name was probably taken to be Greek.
(Ἀσκιπύργιον). quinetiam: always postpositivc in Tacitus: So ch.
8, 20; 13, 8; 34, 23, 45, 15. ' ’

30. Ulixl=ab Uliee. This socelled subjective dative, occurs
more than 30 times in Tacitus. In this treatisc again, ch. 16,18; 34,
22; 45, 29; and cp. Suet. Aea. 1, ara Octavio consecrata, where the
context also precludes a dative ci reference. Laertae: we have no
means oi knowing how this error originated. The alleged presence oi
the name was, however, supposed to dispel any possible doubt as to
the trustworthiness oi the identification with the Homeris hero. It
has been not improbably conjectured that some iorm like the Etrus-
can Lars, Lartis, Scottish lard, Engl. lord, may have been mistaken ior
Laertae.

monumentaque et tumulos: the specilla is added to the more
generic term, on which see Iatrod. p. lxviii.

³2. Graecis litteris, etc: Caes. B.a.'1;29‚1; VI. 14, 3, speaks
oi their use among the Gauls. They were more probably written iu
the but slightly different Etruscan alphabet, as appears irom coins
and lrom inscriptions found ia cartilato Raetiae.

Paga 34. 1. neque confirmare, etc. : although qualiiying state·
ments oi this nature are characteristic oi Tacitus (sea note Dial. 12,
19), this particular passage seems to be a reminiscence oi Liv. Praes.

2. ingenio: disposition.

3. demat vel addat fldem: willlold or emplastratio belieyt .

The phrase is poetic. In Tacitus, Hist. 11. 50; 111. 39; Aac. 1v. 9.

Ohapier 4. 4. Ipse: opposed to quidam above, and saturning to
ch. 2, 1, crediderim.
