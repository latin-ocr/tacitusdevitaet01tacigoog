all that seemed to him of real value, may also be asserted
with entire confidence3 but the moment we approach the
question as to the specific extent of his direct indebtedness
to his predecessore, we are confronted with a problem as
difficultas it is fascinating.

The possible sources of Tacitus for the Germanic may be
classified under three heads ε -

1. Firsthand inforrnation gathered by the author him-
self in German territory through personal interviews and
observations.

2. Information, chiefly oral, fnrnished by persona] friends
or military officere who had been in Germany or on the
frontier.

3. Literary recorda dealing incidentally or exclusively
with German ethnology and geography.

The first possibility, though strenuously advocated by ¹

many scholare,l must, however, be rejected, for the treatise
does not contain a solitary item which could be accounted
for only on the supposition of a personal visit, not to men·
tion that such a journey of exploratior would have been
next to impossible on the part of a Roman, even in those
regions to which Roman legions had at one time or another
penetrated Finally, a number of passages in the treatise
itself wouldvneoessarily have been expressed differently if
Tacitus had himself come into contact with the people
= whom he describes.2

But while the authors knowledge of Germany was thus
