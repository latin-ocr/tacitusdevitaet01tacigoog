I. 63, non cb praedam nat spoliandi cupidine. mcx: subsequently,
the usual meaning in Tacitus. So again, ch. 10, 10.

16. Germani is the Latin rendition cf some Teutonic word‚.now
lost, and means brerae-en, and so the ancients themselves always under-
stood it. cp. Strab0, IV. 4, 2 (γνήσιοι) ; Plut. Murius 26 (ἀδελφοί);
Vell. Pat. 11. 67, de Gcrnecnis (sc. Lepido et Planco fratribus), non de
Gallis dno triumphant consules. The Teutonic or Celtic etymologias
generally given for this word are largely mere guesswork, and incom-
patible with the meaning of the context. Tha hypothesis itself is
unquestionably erroneous, for the German peoples did not have a
generic name till the llth century, when Dentsclr (Tentsch) had
become established as such· The present passage and the one cited
from Caes. Bri. II. 4, 10, are in all likelihood based upon Posidonius.

Ohapttr 3. 17. et=eticna cleo, ie. Hercules among others. So
below, 1. 26. Herculem: i.e. the interpretatio Romana (or Graeca)
identified him with Donar (Ther), who has many characteristica and
attributes in common with Hercules. Thus, both fight with giants
and monsters and descend to the lower world, both are great wan-
derers and benefactore of man, being appealed to as ἀλεξίκακοι, both
finally are represented as of a rustic character and uncouth demeanor.
Others regarded Jupiter as a better parallel, hence dies Iocis, Fr.

memorant sc. qnidam auctores, as l. 26. Gernrani is impossible
here, not so much because this would require sc in place of eos, for
this confusion occurs elsewhere in Tacitus, but simply because the
identification in question could not heve emanated from the Germane
themselves Cp. also note oh. 9, 25. primumque: ared nan mutter
os fact, etc. On this asseverative force oi -qne, sce ag. 2, 10; 5, 30,
b, 27. Prirnnnr :principem Cp. Lucrct. 1. 86, primunirorurn.

18. virorum fortium: heroes. The designation is only apparently
inconsistent with ch. 9, 27, for Hercules is a dcmigod and as such
partakes of both human and divine characteristica Here the former
ere emphasized, as also in Ana. II. 12. canunt sc. Germani.
The somewhat abrupt change of subject is nnobjcctionable, whenever
no ambiguity is involved, as here and ch. t, ll; 6, lt ; 14, 27; 20, fi.
Such battle songs are often referred tc.

19. Sunt illis haec quoque camina: ie. besides the cpio lays,
