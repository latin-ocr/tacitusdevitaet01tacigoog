context proves, auctor is here used without the accessory meaning oi
trustwcrthiness, a signification, though extremely common in post-
Augustan Latin, still foreign to earlier writers. oblongae scutellae:
the exact shape oi the dish called scutula is unknown. It may have
been rectangular armore like a trapezoid or trapezium. Oblonyae
seems to indicate an elongation of two cf its sides, which in a rough
way mightcorrespondtothe configuration of Great Britain. bipenni:
the centenos the double battle-ax, representing the uarrowest part of
the island. As aei, in place of aut, seems to show, there cannot have
been any essential difference inform between the scutula and the
bipennis. But such comparisons must not, in any case, be too closely
pressea, based as they were upon very vagus and untrustworthy in·
formation.

12. adsimulavsre: a plural predicate after two singular subiects
in adversative clauses is one of the characteristic features of Tacitcan
usage. Here the incongruity is all but done away with hythe plural
apposition. So also eg. Aah. XII. 1, huia Pallas, ilii Callistus sata
tores aderaut. Et: aad as a matter os fact. This asseverative use
of et, at the beginning of a sentence, is common in Tacitus. (if. eg.
22‚21; Gerra35, 14. oltra: siae Seech.1‚ 12. unde: sc.
oriebatur. With unde (18 instances), and similarly with hiric, inde,
ea eo, and the like, Tacitus omits the verb. Iu the smaller works
again, Germ. 4, 7, uada tabitam 9, 29, ande cereso.

1³. in universum fama: ic. the erroneous notion gained general
acceptance that the entire island, including Caledonia, had the shape t

spoken of. transgressis: this dative of local staudpoint, akin to ἐκ.

the Greek dative absolute, is first found in Varro L. L. V. ti. cp. '

note ch. 11, 10. ’ίιιιιιωιιειιιιιιΙ . . spatium: the phrase occurs in '

five other places in Tacitus. Under the influence oi Vergil he de-
velops an increasiug fondness for inmensas, tartareis, iugens, using
them generally in the sense of acaunus. enorme: here shapeiess,
hut usually synonymous with inmensus, eg. ch. 36, 3.

14. litore . . . tenuatur: a dactylis hexameter. Verses in prose,
whether complete or particulare severely censured by the ancients.
(lp. eg. Cic. Orat. 20, 67 and Quint. IX. 4, 7, and but few genuine
instances occur, the rhythmical cadeuce being in the maiority of cases
not felt, if the sentence is properly read. The present line, how-
ever, Ana. 1. l, though faulty, and especially (lerna. 39, 13, augariis
