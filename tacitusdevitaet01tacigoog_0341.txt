On the significance ο1 this discrepancy, sce Introd. p. lxiii. quam·

4. omnium . . . gentium: viz. in ch. 29 ff. The statement is
exaggerated for rhetorical reasons. lateribus: boanduries, ie.

to the ocean and the north, 1111111 to the interior.

5. obtenditur: seces, stratones along opposite. So Agr. 10, 7;

tur: 11 Tacitus was not misiniormed or led into error by inaccuratc
maps, wa must suppose that the Chauci and Chatti had respectively
moved south aud north and occupied part oi the reglons oi the
Cherusci and Fosi 11111 their downiall, the Angrivarii shiiting into
the territory oi the Bructeri. See ch. 33, oi.

abstract noun with sine is the idiomatic substitute in Latin 111 a
