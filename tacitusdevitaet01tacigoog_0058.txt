THE SOURCES OF THE GERMANIA. xlix

satisfactory accuracy. Now, acareful comparison between
the two authors, where they deal with tho same or similar
topics, reveals the fact that there is but a single passage in
the Germanic which can be said to betray the direct influ-
ence of Caesar,¹ for the few bther verbal coincidences² per·
tain to statements which would naturally be expressed in
but one way. Other items of information exhibit either
noteworthy dicerpcncco or amplifications of so significant a
character as to preolude Caesar as the direct or even the ulti-
mate source of Tacitus on the subjecte in question. In lact,
the wealth oi new details and the very nature of the mate
rial in the Germanic bear eloquent testimony to the advance
made in the geographioal and ethnological knowledge of
Germany since (laesar's time. Caesar, it cannot but bo
admitted, had at best only a superficial acquaintance with
Germanic tribes, an acquaintance, moreover, acquired under
one-sided conditions‚ for their most characteristic customs,
ceremonies, and modes of life could only be observed in
times of pecca A considerable part of the information
which he furnished on those subjects was, therefore, nec-
essarily secured at second hand. Nay, it can even still
be shown that Caesar had himself occasionally consulted
earlier litcrcry sources³ which were, of course, equally
accessible to Tacitus.

Caesar to the Gaulo exclusively.
