19. delectos: elsewhere in the minor writings Tacitus has eligere.
On this change of usage, ep. note Dici. 10, 31. ante eciem: as the
place of honor. Cp. eh. 31, 22.

20. Definituretnumeme: sc. peditamdelectoram‚ iustmentioned,
for that the equitatus was an elite corps is taken ior granted. 'lhe
present passage, therefore, merely distinguishes between a select
infantry and the rank and file cf pedites, called acies below. Observa
the emphatic position oi the predicate: aad what’s more, evea their
camber is fitted. centeni ex singulis pagis: the decimal system
in military and political organisations is primitive Indo-Europaeo, and
particularly conspicuous among the Hindoos, Persians, and Romana
Α papus according to Caes. B. 0. IV. 1, 4, formed the one-hundredth
part oi a geas or civitas, contributing annually a thousand soldiers,
which would thus correspond to the Roman tribus. A hundred delecti
pedites (the equites are here not discussed for the reason given
above) would, therefore, constitute a sufficiently small contingentia
make it a distinction and an honor to belong ιο it. That the exact
one hundred was occasionally exoeeded seems to be implied in qaod
priato cameras suit, the original designation being traditionally
retained, as in the analogous ease of the Roman centumviri and of
the German cetetner, which in different localities and at different times
was equivalent to 110 pounds. Cp. also note ch. 12, 27.

21. idque ipsum: viz. tonderi, tendered, brendertschast.
quod: for qai. On the neglect of the attraction,cp.ch.18, l; and
note to Ayr. 21, 3.

22. nornen: title. On the singular predicate, see Iatrod. p. lxix.
Acies: here the common soldiery, as opposed to tlte equites and
delecti pedites per cuneos: awedgelike, compact formation, like
a Greek Δ. From its shape, the Romans compared it to a boar's head
(captet porci). This method of formation was still in use aelate as
the battle of Hastings (1060 an).

2³. Cedere loco: this was in marked contrast to Roman disci-
pline and is sneeringly alluded to by Germanicus in his speech on the
eve oi the battle ol Idisiaviso. Cp. Ana. ll. 14, stae cura dueum abire,
strpere, and ch. 30, 8. dummod0=dam. In Tacitus only herc
and Dici. 25, 14. consilii quam=a petias patrm, a precs os
discretiori ratker thart os sear. This peculiar ellipsis, probably a col·
loquialism, occurs first in Plaut. Eud. (vs. 1114), tacitast borsa mulier
seraper qaam loqueos. ln Tacitus it is found in fifteen other passages,
but only here iu the minor works. The genitives may be regarded
