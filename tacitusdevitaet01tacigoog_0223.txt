Tacitean usage.

Pago 27. 1. slve verum istud, etc. ε such phrases, qualifyinga
direct charge or innuendo, are specially characteristic cf Tacitus. Cp.
noteDial.12,19. ex: in heeptny nith, in accordance nith. A
rnodal use of the proposition exceedingly frequent in Tacitus.

phor. cultu modicus: anestentaticns in bis mode os lise. We
expect the genitive or in, as in Plin. Epist. I. 22, 4, quam parcas e'n
nictu, quarn modicus in culta, but the simple ablativa, though occa·
sionally found with this adjective, is perhaps here primarily used for
