the friend and toacher of Cicero, has only iu recent times
been restored to honor. His influeuce, especially upon the
Romans, in many fields of human knowledge, has been
incalculably profound and lasting. His Ἱστορίαι, in fifty-two
books, which began where Polybius left off and continued
the narrative to the time of Sulla (ie. from 144 to c. 80 uc),
was extensivoly utilized by later writers, such as Livy,
Strabo, Diodorus, Plutarch, and many others, the exhaustive
account of the wars with the Cimbri and Teutones, in par·
tioular, enjoying canonio authority. Distinguished by all
the graces of style, his writings abounded in elaborate dis-
cussions of a geographieal, ethologioal, and ethnologioal¹
nature, and he everywhere manifested a keen interest iu
religious origine, mythology, and the development of
society. With Tacitus he shared to a remarkable degree the
tendenoy to idealize thetimes aud barbarian communities.
Thus the strikingly similar reflectione on the purity aud
rigbteousness of the Scythians, found agiu Verg. Georg.

demonstrably Posidonian. Livy, Caesar, and, above all,
Sallust, especially in his introductione to the Catilina and
Joyortho, drank from the same fountain. Varro, also, in his
monumental work, entitlcd Antiquitotee reram hrcmoaotwm
et diuinorum in fortyone books, Seneca, the poet Mani-
lius, and, as late as the fourth century, Ammianus Marcel-
linus, were all alike, though in varying degree, considerably
indebted to this Stoio savant.

1 The doctrine of tho influenoe of climate upon character is directly
attributed to Posidonlus by Galen. Though he cannot be considered
its originator‚ the general familiarity with the idea in later writers is
probably due to him. It is implied in Mela, 111.3,33,ar coeli ae-
perr'orle ito turgenti (ol the Sarmaticus) and esp. inGcrvo.29,134.,
where see note. The sentiment in ch. 19, 22, has also a Posidonlan
ssavor, as pointed out ed loc.
