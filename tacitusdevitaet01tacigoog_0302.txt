in Ana. ΙΙ. 50, cited beloW, the word being herc, as usually, taken in
arestricted sense. cp. note ch. 6,11. 11 would seem that her cloalr
was torn off and her dress cut at the back. coram propinquis:
10. the relatives of both husband and wife. Their presence implied
approval oi the punishment, aud would thus correspond to the actual
trial 01 the wile before her husband and relatives, who served as
assessore, a procedure often mentioned as an old Roman custom, and
said 10 have been introduced by Romulus. Cp. Dionys. Halic. Arci.
II. 25 ; Liv. XXXIX. 18, 6 ; Suet. Tib. 35, and Tac. Ana. II. 503 XIII.

12. per omnem vicum: 11000011 the entire 0111000. verbere

agit: cp. the passage in an old law of the Lombards, publicas . . .

’ societ cos decalvare (ε abscisis crinibus) 01 faetore per oicos,· and in
the famous letter 01 St. Boniiace, written in 145 10,, 10 the Anglo·
Saron king Ethelbald, we find a very similar statement, flagellatam
enne mulieres per 110000 .. . descendente caedentes 01 uestimento
‘einsobecidcntes iacto cingulum . . . 01 ceterae timorem adulterandi
...noceant publicatae enim, etc: enim, with the usual
ellipsis to be supplied. This may seem a very severe punishment
ior the 0101101000,5010001001110101100 once 51000111 to 0011100011οο
(in the way described) finds no pordon onatsoeoer.

13. pudicitiae: ecncbcstity, disproce, ameaning quite common in
its synonym, pudor. Ilngl. 0110010 isequally ambiguous. For avery
bold transferenda 01 a positive into its negative, cp. Lucret. V. 1405,
000100 (= 00001 os 01000). ,

14. maritum sc. olium or atterum, as is clear from the pre-
ceding and the following, esp. l. 1511. For a similar ellipsis, cp. ch.
10,15; 23, 12, Introd. Agr. p. xxxi. 3. invenerit: sc. adultero.
vitia: vice.

1⁵. conrumpere et conrumpl: 00 J'oined in Ano. XIV. 20, and
similarly 111. 54, 0001110100 nimai et conceptor. Tacitus oiten thus
combines the active aud the passive oi the same verb, eg. Agr. 5, 28,
noscere. . . 110001 ; Dici. 8, 17, acceperint . . . accipi possit. Cp.
mosomenses. saeculum: the spirit ostie noe, the cocy os
tbc world. In this sense the word does not seem tc occur elsewhere.
Melius quidem adhuc sc. 00001 ; 0νο indeed stili better off, adhuc:
etium is citen used in post-Augustan Latin to strengthen a comparative.
With the ellipsis 01 a verb 01 doing, frequent in Tacitus, cp. eg. Agr.
