four-year-old daughter, and his wile Poppaea—Observe the skiliul

part in Wodan's broad-hriurmed hat, the eadueeus in his staff ; both
act as chthonic deities and are the gods 01 cultural progress par excel-
lence. Engl. Weduesrey (= Wodunsdey) and the Treuch Mercredi
( :Mercurii dies) imply the same identification, which is perhaps due
to Posidonius. lt was still acceptedas late as the 8th century. The

all primitive rituals, the substitution 01 animals being invariably a

ch. 39, 16; 40, 15, and Aua. XIII. 67, where the custom 01 sacrificing
