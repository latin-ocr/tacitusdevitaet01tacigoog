grounds. For not only is the insertion oi crebrae eruptiones between
intrepida biems‘and et sibi quisque praesidio paleographically unwar-
ranted, but it also involves a flagrant violation oi the Tacitean usage
oi et aiter an asyndeton, aud at the same time rudely separatas two

22, 21. et erat ut] et at crat-Hemichsen. This emendation,
independently suggested also by Purser, l.c. p. 192, is extremely easy
and satisfactory, while at erat of the MSS. or et erat at is awkward
and ambiguous, referring equally to what precedes and to what iol-
lows. But Tacitus would certainly not affirm the charge involved in
acerbior. With Henricbsen’s reading, he qualifies the statement in
two ways. Agricola was not acerbas, but at best only iniucundus,
and even that only adversas maios, ior he was habitually carnis banis.

2³, 25. percucurrerat] percurrerat—Bm), Woelfflin. Tacitus
seems to have avoided the reduplicated forms in eompounds.

24, 32. nave prima transgressus: crossing over with a lieet ior
the first time. The conjectures made to this passage are without
exception unwarranted. See Ο. li. 328 and notes ad loc.

interpolation oi interiora parunt, apart irom its baldreas, attributes
to Tacitus amosi gratuitous statement. In melias is probably the
marginal note or interlinear gloss oi some patriotic Irish scribe which
subsequently intruded into the text. The MS. tradition oi the Agric-
ola being distinct iram the other works oi Tacitus, and the contente
oi this particular chapter appealing, as it must have done, directly to
Irishmen, lends color to the supposition that the archetypon came
from one oi the famous Irish scriptoria. Scribas bave often relieved
their feelings by marginal remarks oi this nature.

25, 21. timebantur] timebat-Bitian, liniebant-MSS. Agricola
is the subject throughout (incohabat, amplexae, exploravit). There
is, therefore, no reason ior writing timebantur, particularly as timebat
is an equally simple correction. Agricola ieared that the march oi
alioman army might be rendered dangerous by the presence of the
natives through whose territory they had to pass. s

The MSS. read aaa remigante, which is admittedly cormpt.
