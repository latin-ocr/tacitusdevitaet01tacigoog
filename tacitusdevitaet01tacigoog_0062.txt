was so captivated by a rhetorical treatise which contained
next to nothing for his purpose, that he did not hesitate to
adopt its commonplaoe phraseology and appropriate its most
nondescript expressions.

Pliny's Natural flietorp—Tacitus indebtedness to the
Natural History of the elder Pliny has been advocated with
no less confidence, and yet this assumption is also demon-
strably erroneous. Admitting, what is not improbable, that
Tacitus was aequaiuted with this encyclopaedia, it does not,
in the first place, seem plausible that he laboriously searched
all through so voluminous a compilation for details to be
utilized in his Garsauria ,· for, with the exception of a short
chapter in bk. IV, Pliny's references to Germany are few,
incidental, and scattered over the thirty-seven books. Now,
if we examine the passages upon which the above convic
tion is primarily based-they arebat two in number,-
we find that these, on the contrary, afford the clearest evi-
dence that the Natural History was not put under contri-
bution.

Thus Pliny (IV. 13, 28, 99 f.) divides all Germanic races

into five large groups.1 Tacitus, on the other hand, cites
only three, omitting the first and last, but mentions another
elassification on the authority of older sources,² which added
the Vandali and three other tribes, one of which, the Suebi,

is given as a subdivision by Pliny, while the other two are

omitted altogether. Again, the Suebi are clearly differens
tiated by Tacitus from the Herminones, in flat contradiction
to Pliny. Finally, of the tribes enumerated hythe latter,
