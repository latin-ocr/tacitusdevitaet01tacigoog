was also part of the Dionysus cult and generally very widesprecd
seems to have been unknown to Tacitus or hie authorities. signum
ipsum: the very symbol oi the goddess as distinct from the ceremony

connected with her. liburnicae: sc. acuis. It was possibly the ¹

forcipe character oi the veseel (see note Aur. 28, 8), not the veescl as
such, which led to the hypothesis.

Pago 37, 1. advectam: either by land or sec, ior the verbis
used in both senece. The question cannot be decided here, as it de-
pende, in a measure, upon the location oi the pare Sueborum. · Ii
understood oi the upper Danube, the former would be implied; li in
Plaudere, the latter would he possible. On the whole, it seems that
Tacitus would have decided that the cult was introduced overland, ior
in ch. 2,14‚he ir speaking oi whole migratione in preliatoric tium,
whereas the Roman Isis cult was of comparatively recent date ( Second
Punic War). religionem: oi barbarian religioue beliefe, Tacitus
generally uses the term ereperetitio, but the worship oi Isis, though
originally Egyptian, had by this time become closely associated with
Roman religion, not to mention that in the present case the cult was
supposed to have been imported. Ceterum: but to return to their

On such· ianciiul reflectione see note ch. 7, tend Iatrod. p. lxiii.

2. cohibere parietibus: the statement is, oi course, seli-evident
among a people who were just emerging from a pastoral or nomadic

denoted merely a sacred enclosure, and thie ie still the only meaning
in Lucretius. A very similar explanation ie given by Cic. de rep. ΙΙΙ.

probably still true oi the Germane in general in Tacitue' time, ior even
the Goths oi the 401 century had not yet advanced beyond rude sym·

4. lucos ac nemore: the same collocation occure in Tacitus again,
ch. 10, 183 45, 21; and in Dici. 12, 29, with secretum following, as
here. These sacred grovee are often referred to, eg. ch. 39,1:l; 40,
53 43, 24; Aoo. 11. 12; IV. 73. On the adversative asyndeton, see
Introd. p. lxvii. nominibus: instrumental ablativo.

⁵. secretum illud, etc. : that mysterioae presence which they uetat
