3. ἔπιπνδεύμοτα. 4. πράξεις. 5. σύγκρισις. 6. ἐπίλογος. Their
order is definitely fixed only for the first, the second, and
the last, in the arrangement of the others certain preferences
are expressed, but otherwise considerable latitudo is allowed.
No rhetorically trained writer seems to have ventured to
emancipate himself from this traditione] norm, except in
minor details3 but in the handling oi the subject matter,
an author was less hampered‚ his treatment being natu-
rally conditioned by countless consideratione inherent in
the theme itself, in the-circumstances under which he
wrote, and in the purpose he had in view.

Now a comparison between these rhetorical precepts and
illustrations and the Agricola reveals the fact that Tacitae,
as iar as possible, followed similar models.

1. Prooemium (ch. 1-3). As already remarked‚ no rigid
or precise rules for the introduction to the βασιλικὸς λόγος
or any other of the many encomia are laid down, but instead
alarge number of suggestions is enumerated from which a
choice might be made. The prooemium of the Agricola is
one of exquisite art and originality, for not only does it
impart considerable informaticn of astrictly introductcry
nature, but, at the same time, it succeeds in giving that
pecrdiar'pcrspective in which Tacitus doubtless desired his
readers to view the story of this hero.

2. Γένισις, φύσις, ἀνατροφή. These subjecte are discussed
in ch. 4 f, the resemblance to Menander's illustratione being
particularly striking,l a fact which, of course, does not
invalidate the trustworthiness of the statements themselves.
Itis, moreover, not the identity of arrangement as such
