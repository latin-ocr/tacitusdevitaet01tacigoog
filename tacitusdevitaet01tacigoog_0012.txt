PREFACE
ΤΟ THE GERMANIA.

Tun literature which has accumulated about this immortal ’

treatise is well-nigh overwhelmiug, my own bibliography‚ though
probably iar from exhaustive‚ filling about fourteen printed
peges. Under these circumstances there cau be but little room
for originality‚ and the chief tnsk of 88 editor of a book of this
nature will primarily consist in a careful sitting aud an exten·
sive condensation oi the exegetica] material furnished by gen·
eratione of German scholars; for, with the possible exception oi
Fustel de Coulangm, no others seem hitherto to have contributed
anything oi real value to the elucidation oi the Germanic. But
in spite of this fact, there still remain not a few passages which
have in my judgment been uniformiy misinterpreted‚ scholars being
somewhat reluctant to recognize au ars nesciendi, or prone to read
into the treatise of Tacitus what they strongly felt ought to be
there. ln 811 these instances, as well as in many others in which
traditional views seemed to me unwarrauted‚ Ι have, even at the
rish oi iucurring the charge of presumption, not hesitated to give
my own concinemus, although the scope and aim oi this edition
precluded their detaiied justification.

Itis, oi course, quite impossible to enumerate all the scholars
to whom I am under obligations, and I can, therefore, iu this
place mention only those works to which I am specially indebted
throughout. 01 more recent commentariea I have always had
