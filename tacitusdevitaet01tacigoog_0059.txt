tion, and if it be further observed that Tacitus was iu every
instance in possession oi fuller and more reliable knowl-
edge than was vouchsafed to Caesar, we cannot but reject
the assumption of ostensive indehtedness, and must conclude
that the Commorientes, though irertainly documents of prime
importance, cannot, in the eyes of Tacitus, writing as he
did more than a¹ century later, have had anything more than
an historical interest and velue.

Two other worhs, also still extant, have without misgir-
ings or qualifications been likewise put down among the
certain sources of the Germanic, namely‚ the chorographiis
of one Pomponius Melo (c. 50 no.) and the socelled Natural
History of the elder Pliny, numerous alleged resemblances,
both in conterits and phraseology, having been adduced in
support of this view. But this inference is vitiated at
the very outset by the nonobservance of a methodical
canon in investigations of this nature, which, though gen-
erally ignored, is essential if our conclusione are to rest on
a firm foundation. It may be briefly formulated by saying
that mere similitude, though apparently never so striking,
does notin itseli afford any reliable clew to indcbtedness,
provided there exist side by side equally noteworthy diver-
gences or contradictions; even where this is not the case,
the possibility must always be taken into consideration that
= such parallelisms are due either to a common third source
or conditioned by the similarity of the subjectmatter.

Now, if we apply this cardinal principle to the two
authors in question, it will be fomrd that the hitherto uni-
versally accepted conclusion that Tacitus was directly in-
debted to thern is unwarranted by the facts.

Pomponius Mela—In the reign of Claudius, one Pom-
poniae Mela ccrnposed a compendious geography oi the
world (situs orbis) in three books. The author tells us,
in his Preiace, that the subject does not lend itsclf
