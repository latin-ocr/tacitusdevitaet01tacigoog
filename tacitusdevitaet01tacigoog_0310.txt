Pege 44. 1. vinolentos: intoaiccted. ln the same general sense,
tor the German beverage was beer (ses below), eg. Ana. XI. 16,1ι1ι1-
pias vinolentiam oc libidines (drunlrenness and excesses) grata bar-
baris (sc. Cheruscis); Hist. IV. 79 (cited above, l. 31); and ch. 23, 13.
rixae: an ordinary quarrel that comes 10 blows. Cp. note Dici. 26, ὅ,
conviciis: vituperatiae abaco. This was considered unmanly. cp.
Nibelanaen Noth, 2282, aar <ioth it heseem heroic lips to scald illae old
1111111111. Haughty speeches in challenging to comhat were, however,
in lavor, ag. Β10111111,49911. caede et vulneribus: a frequent
collocation in Tacitus, ag. Hist. Ill. 26; IV. 20;Α1111. XII. 35.
saepius: eight osten, asin ch. 17, 14, 22, 28.

2. transiguntur: are settled. The statement oi the author is
confirmed by later testimony. Thus the len Saliae (5111 century) takes
cognizanea oi cases 11· qais in convivio faerit intersectas, arrd Donizzo's
aila Mactata Il. 115011. (= Maiiam. Germ. XII. p. 390), written in
1149, contains some lines which seem like an echo of this very passage,
although it is unlikely that a MS. 01 the Germania existed in ltaly at
that early date: qni (Alemanni) peramant Boeotum . . . faciles rixas·
1111111111 potati pro verbis, fertur, 01111111 11111111 denudant, sociorum
viscera truncant. et: even. de reconciliandis . . . 1111110111

111111 twenty times in Tacitus, eg. ch. 37, 8 ; but iu the classical, adver-
sative sense, itis found only ch. 18, 27 ; 21, 24.

3. iungendis adfinitatibus: contractiones marriage alliances.
cp. ch. 18, 21. We should expect adfinitas, to balance inimicis and
principibus, but the concrete noun would have been ambiguous here.
adsciscendis principibus: this probably refers more particularly to
the formation oi the concitatas, on which see ch. 13 1., 101 the would-be
concites were ires to select their princeps, but alliances with neighbor-
ing chieitains, alludcd to ch. 13, 111, may also have been arranged at
these maetings.
