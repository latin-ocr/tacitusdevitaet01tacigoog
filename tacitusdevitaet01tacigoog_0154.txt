provinces and the degenerated society oi Rome is often emphasized
by Tacitus. (lp. ηοω Diui. 28, 13.

16. philosophiae: this word (like philosophus) israrely used by
Tacitus. See note ch. 2, 3.—Thc apathetic and, at times, hostile
attitndc oi the Romans toward the stndy oi philosophy is well
attested. See note to Dici. 19, 7, and especially Suet. Nero 52.

1⁷. (studium) hausisse: (studio) se dedisse. The infinitiva
represents hauriebat in direct duconrse; hausturum fuisse must be
supplied in thought as the apodosis to ui . . . coercuisset. So ch.
13, 23, agitasse satis coastat. Seelmroa.p.xxxii.urans1ate: He
was ou tlte point os devotiw himself to . . . aud lle would leae
dous so, llud aot, etc. incensum ac flagrantem: sc. studio
philosophiae-Incensus, in its metaphorioal sense, is extremely
rare ; flagroue exceedingly common. —Observe the accumulatior oi
synonyme in this closing paragraph. cp.1mroe. p. xxix.

18. sublime et erectum: the same collocation occurs in Quia.
XI. 1, 16, and similarly Cic. Tusa. V. 14, 42, celsus et erectus.

19. pulchritudinem sc speciem: beautiful ideal. Hendiadys.

20. caute: we should expect the comparative, but a similar in- ,

mance of inconcinnity is met with in Tac. Hist. Ι. 83, acrius quam
coauderute. Cp. also Aac. IV. 61, Aprippiua claris maioribus quam
sumtu, where clarioribus and uetustioribus were avoided ior euphonia
reasons. —That the cantion was necessary is evident from the punish-
ment which some emperors inflicted upon philosopham. See ηοω
ch. 2, 3.

, 21. ratio et astes: pulicum tllat scates uitii ope. οη the epexe-
getic et, see Iatrod. p. xxx. The singular predicate with two abstract
nouus joined by et is the rulo in Tacitus. Where the verb in the
singular precedes it may be supposed to agree with the nearer subject.
When the subjecte are joined with ac or atque, we find the plural, as
in oh. 42, 25, exceptions being very rare. See also Dial. 5, 18.

retinuitque: ouri iu consequence lte retained. This usage oi -que is ·

extremely frequent in Tacitus. -Observc the harsh change oi subject.
22. ex sapientis: the staua os philosophy. modum ι modero-
tioa-Tacitus constantly emphasizes this quality as the cardinal
, virtm oi his hero, and the rhetoricians speak oi it as an casentini
clement oi characterization in encomia. See Iutrod. p. xii. note 2.
