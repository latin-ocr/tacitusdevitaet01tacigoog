omnic Oceanus poet Oceanum nihii. Tacitus held to the dish-shapcd
form oi the earth3 cp. notes Apr. 12, 32. 1. The confident assertion,
et sarua uera, may possibly be due to the information frunished by
Agricola's choumnavigation of Britain.

4. Ergo: ie. since the world is here at un end, Inow turntuthe
east oi the Baltic. Suebici maria: this designation ior the Baltic
occurs only here. Cp. note ch. 43, 19, Suebici. Aestiorum genter:
they belonged tu the Balto-Slavio group and are the ancestors oi the

old Prussians, Lithuanians, and Letts. Their language, which to the
untrained ear oi traders (ior it is to them that Tacitus’ information is
ultimately to be traoed back) sounded like Celtic, would be alone suffi-
cient to stamp the Aestii ae non-Germanic; but the fact that language Ῐ

is one oi tha priucipal criteria oi ethnical differentiation is a com-
paratively modern discovery, and Tacitus’ erroris, therefore, quite
excusable.

5. lingua Britannicae propior: the British islanda were con-
ceived as much nearer to these regions than they are, and hence the

linguistic relationship oi some other Celtic tongue with that of the ,

Aestii the more readily suggested itseli to unscientiiic observem who
had heard both spoken.

6. Matrem deum: i.e. ru. deorum, as in Aua. IV. 64, apud aedem
Matris derunt. In all probability here the same as the Terra muter, or
uuapuu Mater Idaea, mentioned ch. 40, 3, where see note. 'lhese oults
were clearly distinguished by the Romans, but the wearing oi animal
symbols by the devotees of the Magna Mater and the similar practica
noted among the Aestii were sufficient ior the interpretatio Romana
to identiiy the two deities.

7. iormaa aprorum gestant: the bour was a Germanic symbol oi
courage. Cp. Beowuli 304,-

The hoar’s likeness shown:
Over the visor, with gold adorned,
Bright and firehardened‚ the boar kept μετὰ.

8. omnium: neuter. Cp. note ch. 39, 21.

9. Rarus. . . usus: this would be in keeping with the peace-
loving disposition oi the Aestii, attested, as late as the 6th century, by
Cassiodorus, Var. V. 2, pacatum hunricum penus omuino. -

10. Prumeuta ceterosque tructus: cereale aud other fruita os
thefleld. patientius: more eruar-curculio pro solita Germ·
”mm inertia: cp. ch. 14, 24, 15,6; 22, 27, and esp. 26, 18 it. ‘
