last subiect ior whom this ancient honor was decreed, but he declined
it twice, in 19 and 14 nc. After the timo oi Hadrian, its empty sub-
stitnte was also done away with. inlusms statuae: the statne trt-
ampliatis, or laureata, as it is variously called, was since the time ol
Augustus placed in the Forum.

22. quidquid: we should expect qntdqnid alind, asin Dicl. ὅ, l ;
19, l. multo verborum honore: the repetition of bonore is pos-
sibly designed to convey the impressiones the emptiness and mean-
ingless characteres these alleged marks oi distinction.

23. addique: Domitian also suggested that the senate should
spread the information that, asan additional mark of imperial favor,
Agricola’s appointment as governor oi Syria was soon to follow. -
opinionem shows that this intimation was not given in the decree

older men, for the meaning aiore distinguished, generally given to the

27. codicillos: letters patent.

28. dabam: a kind of epistolary imperfect, regarded from the
point oi view ol the recipient. -Thc new appointment was to be
made known to Agricola only to insure a speedy acquiescence in the
recall which had been sent to him previously, Domitian fearing that
Agricola might not comply with it, but the general's loyal conduct,
eyinced by bis immediate departure, rendered this stratagem un-

necessary.
