The following brief synopsis of the specially noteworthy
rhetorical features of the Germanicis primarily intended to
exhibit at a glance to what extent this scientific treatisc is
stylistically differentiated from the biography of Agricola,
tho comparison being particularly instructive, because both
works were written about the semetime.1

1. COLLOCATIO VERBORUM.

37, 14, Scauro Aurelio.

2. Predicote 111 011111101100 position:

34, 24; 36, 22; 39, 22; 43, 24. In ablatioe absolutes: 3, 243 11, 13;

(p. xxvii. 6), the Germanic has but one instance 01 an ablativo ab
solute at the close 01 s sentence (ch. 37, o), and it occurs significantly
in the only strictly historical chapter of the treatlse. The infinitiva is
often at the beginning, with the finite verb at the end: 3, 17; 6, 23 ;
8, 20; 21, 10; 25,5; 34, 23. Cp. note Ayr. 42, 24.
