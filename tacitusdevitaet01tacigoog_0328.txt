9. obsequio: iopaity, sc. erpo Romanoa. Mattiacorum:
like the Batavi, they were closely related to the Chatti, and toolr part
in the uprising oi Civilis, all mention oi which is strangely avoided in
this and the following chapter. Their hot springs (the modern Wies-
baden) are mentioned by Plin. N. H. XXXI. 2, 17, 20.

10. protulit: on the emphatic position, cp. latrari. p. lxvi.

11. ultraque: aad ia certaequence, the -que being epexegetic,
which also accounts ior the repetition of the preposition. imperii:
objectiva genitive with reuerentiam. Ita: itaque. ennoean.
2, 14. aede finibusque: ablatives oi specification.

12. mente animoque: here joined to balance the preceding syno-
nymic group, though the collocation is extremely common, ag. Ter.
Andr. Ι. 1, 137 (vs. 164) ; Lucret. ΙΙΙ. 140, 403; and Tac. rhea Ι. 84.
agrrnt: used ἀπὸ κοινοῦ ; concretely with ia sata ripa (dwell), figura
tively with nobiscum (side with). They were organized aiter the
defeat oi Civilis into the cirritos Mattiacorum Taureaoium.

13. cetera: contrasted only with ta saia ripa, as shown by aiat
quoa, eta, ior the Batavians had emigrated from their ancestral abodes.
But probably Tacitus wrote ceterum. ipso adhuc terrae suae solo
et caelo, etc: owing to the very climate os their country they are to
this day os a more spirited disposition. Adbuc, a perplexing particle
because oi its varied meanings, is here best taken in the sense oi hodie

’ quoque, asin ch. 3, 1; 28, 9. 13, 34, 24. On scio et caeto = alietate,
cp. note ch. 4, 12. The plateau oi the Mattiaci is contrasted with the
level oi the Batavian island, the resultant characteristics here men-
tioned being still observable in the mercuria] temperament oi the
Rhlnelanders as compared with the greater stolidity oi the Dutch.
The influence oi climate upon character was a phenomenon familiar to
the ancianis. Cp. Ayr. 24, 8f. ; Cic. de dic. 11. 42, 89, who attributes
the doctrine to astrologers; Mela Ill. 4, 33, ut caeli asperioris, ita ia-
perii ,· but esp. Posidonius ap. Galen, de plac. Hipp. V. 290, rard τὰς

τόλμαν, etc. Op. Iutrod. p. lvii.

15. numeraverim: a more modest form oi expressing one’a own
conviction than the singular or plural indicative. Cp. ch. 46, 26;
Dici. 1, 113 Apr. 1, 15.

16. decumam· agros: like Cic. in Verr. ll. 3, 6, 13, aper Siciliae
decumanus, ie. paying a ten per cent tax or tithe. The present desig-
nation occurs only here. Its form is oi doubtful origin, some regard
ing it as developed from decurias, as supernus, infernas from superata
