1101 34] noras. 0111111111 1. 111

cp. eg. 11101. 10, 15. iniectos: best taken in a good sense, not
1010101 but 01100001. Cp. the meaning of conrumpere in ch. 23, 13.

6. propriam et sinceram: distinct und pure. similar synonymia
groups are frequent. Cp. ag. 11101. 28, 5; Hist. IV. 64, sinceras and
1010001 ,· Suet. Aup. 40, 01000100 01 inconceptus. The statement is
doubtless exaggerated and due to the general tendency oi the Greeks
and Romans to idealize the peoples oi the north. Op. Introd. p. lxiii.
01 tantum sul similem: ltlceonlytottsels,· 0010000110. Tacitus is
fond of rounding off a polysyndeton or asyndeton by an amplified
clause, et tactum, ceteri, 001100 being particularly often employed 101
that purpose, 0011001001. p. xvii.

’1. extitisse: 0101111000. habitus. . . corporum: physicol
characteristica. So again, eg. Apr. 11, 2.

- 8. quamquam . . . numero: 100111100111011110000101111010.

The Romans habitually overestimated the population oi Germany. “

With the ellipsis citha verb, cp. ch. 14, 31; 18, 18. Ι1 10 particu-
larly frequent in Tacitus with quamquam and quamvis.

9. truces 01 00010101 oculi: these and the following features 01
the Germana are 011011 alludedtoin 01101001 writers. nrtilae:
blond. Other epithets applied to their hair are flacus, rusus, curi·
000100,ξο1061, πυρρός, χρυσοειδὴς. magna corpora: cp. ch. 20, 24;
0001101101118,0000001010111,Ῑο The Roman
soldiers seldom exceeded 6 10011 11101100 111 height ;·hence the con-
stant marvel at the huge frames 01 their German foes. The statement
itseli hasbeen amply confirmed by the measurements of skeletons‚
and even at the present day the inhabitants 01 northwest Germany
010 among the tallest men known, not excepting the Patagonians.

10. ad impetum: sor srcddcn 011001. They were impetuous, but
shewed no endurance. The same observation 10 frequently made, eg.
Tac.Ann.II.14 ; corpus 01 . . . 01 breuem turpatum calidum, 01000110
auerterunt potientia; 8011110110, 1. 11, 31. laboris atque ope·
rum: The collocation is very common. In Tacitus again, Hist. Il.
10; V. 12; Anu. 1. ‘20; XI. 18. On the adversative asyndeton, cp.
Iutrod. p. lxvii. non eadem patientia: 0000010 1001000οε110
11100010 corporibus, ie. their endurance does not correspond to their
poweriul frames. The ellipsis is analogous to that after aeque
(Dtul. 35, 4) and perinde (ch. 5, 233 Apu. 10, 20).

11. tolerare. . . adsueverunt: with the former, supply adsce-
vervnt; with the latter, tolerare. Such reciprocal ellipses are ex·
tremely rare and less bold than the present instance. Cp. Catuli. 61-
