the preposition in asyndetio and adversative clames, bere combined,
see Iatrod. p. lxvii. Observe the climax. Not only do the lower
classes, as is but natural, and the more enlightened nobles place
implicit confidence in this mode of divination, but the very priests
themselves honestly believe in its efficacy, this being in glaring con-
trast with the cynically avowed rationalism 01 the Roman haruspices
Cp. especially Cic. de diu. ΙΙ. 24, 51, illud Gelonis adutodum scitum
est, quii urirerl se aiebat quod aori rideret haruspex, haruspicem cum
uidisset. The omission 01 etiarn aiter sed, when correlated with uon
solum, modo, tautum, though extremely frequentin the Histories and
Anuuts, occurs in the minor works only here, Diui. 32, 15 and Apu.

23. ministros: merely the serucuts, internectere, like ὑποφῆται.
The ellipsis oi tautum is a characteristic Latin idiom. illos: sc.
equos. conscios: are directly conversant with the divine resolutioris.

25. genus = uetiout‘s, tribe, as often in its restricted sense. Cp.
note ch. 2, 14. cum qus: the postpositive collocation 01 cum
with a relative pronoun is not found ln Tacitus, except Anu. I. 25,
where, however, quibuscum occurs in a direct citation from a letter 01
Tiberius.

where. pro praeiudicio: similar contests are found among the
Greeks, Romans (cp. the Horatii and Curiatii), and later Germanic
tribes, but they all, like the judymeut os (lod, common down to the
10th century, were not regarded as prelimiucry, butas definitely
decisive 01 the issue.

probably they comprised the ceremony oi the investiture with arms
(ch. 13, 31) and manumissiones slaves. principes: contrasted
with omues, and bere almost equivalent to nobiles, the usual vagus-
ness attaching ,to the term, as elsewhere in this treatise‚ especially
when used in the plural. See below, l. 27. consultant: aethe
