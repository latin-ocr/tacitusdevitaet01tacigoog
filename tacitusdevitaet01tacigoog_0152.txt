30. testimonium: menone could not have been used with proe-
sentium bonorum, because the still uncompleted reign oi Traian was
included among these. But, when the Historiae had been published,
their author had decided to reservo the record oi Nerva's and Tbajan’s
beneficent rule ior an independent work, aplan either abandoned or
inretrated by his death. cp. Hiat. 1. l, quod si vita suppeditet, pria-
cipntam Nereae et imperium Troiani . . . senectuti reposui.

³1. interim: ie. pending the conclusion oi my larger and strictly
historical narrative. '¹ ·

³2. laudatus erit eut excusatus: cp. Dici. ch. 10, 7, probate stt.
,tides et libertae excusate. -The fut. peri. with reference ιο the reader's
completed perusal oi the biography. Op. note ch. 1, 14, opus sctit.

Paga 3. cleptore 1. cnaeus rurus Agricon: urs a ene
only certain instance in Tacitus in which the tric nornine Romanorum

occur. They are designed to give to the beginning oi the biography
proper a special solemnity. Foroiuliensium colonia: a town in
Gallia Narbonensis, on the Mediterranean, founded by Julius Caesar
in 46 n.c.; during the early empire it was a naval station oi some inr-
portance. It is the modern Frejus, situated 45 miles northeast oi
Toulon.

2. procuratorem caesarum: the procuratore were officere in the
imperial household, appointed hy, and solely responsible to, the em-
peror. These positione were originally held by freedmen and equites
alilre, but as the administrative functione ol the emperor extended,
the higher and more responsible procuratorslrips were given only to
knights, who were then generally distinguished from the minor ‘pro-
curatores’ ue procuratores Augusti. Gaesarem happens to be found
only here, but Caesaris may have been equally official, the plural
being used doubtless because the grandfathers reierred to served sep-
arately under Augustus and Tiberius, or under both. But cp. Diui.
ch. 7, 7, prootwatores princepum.

3. quae: by attraction ior quod. cp. ch. 7, 8; Gerre. 5, 18.
equestris nobilitas: these offices had become one oi the marks oi
an equestrian career, ior men oi senatorial rank were debarred irorn
holding a procuratorship. The expression itseli, in place oi ordo
equestris, seems not to occur elsewhere, and is here used in the sanie
technical sense which Tacitus repeatedly gives to equites inlustres or
insignes, namely, knights occupying high positions. The exact equiv-
alent, equites nobiles, is also iound, e. g. Liv. XXIII. 46, 12.
