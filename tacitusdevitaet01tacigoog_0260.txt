exception oi the epple, the German names ior truite, such as plums,
cherries, and pears, are borrowed from the Latin, none oi these being
successfully cultivated in Germany until centuries later. pecorum:
probably the domestic animab, exclusive oi cats and dogs.

1⁷. plerumque: frequently. This weakened sense oi the wordis
much the inore common in Tacitus, improcere: sc. pecora sant,
a remarkable ellipsis, but legitimate, in that terra could not be under-
stood with this word. Cp. also note ch. 3, 18. armentis1here
more particularly cattle, as shown by gloria frontis. Caes. B. (Ji. IV.
2, 2, speaking generally ol the native beasts oi burden (tamenta),
styles them pravo and informia, but says they possessed great endur-
ance, being accustomed tohard labor daily.

18. suus honor: their peculim· tenuta, such as Tacitus was accus·
tomed to see in Italian kine. Cp. also Verg. Geory. 111. 51. gloria
irontls: a poetic expression forming the close oi a hexameter, here
added hy way oi closer definition. See Introd. p. lxxi. Fine horns are
usually lacking to German cattle to this day. gaudent: sc.
Germani.

19. solae: ior land was held in common (ch. 26), and silver and
gold were not found in any appreciable quantities. The statement is
confirmed by the old Teutonic words (satha, seolt), signifying both
cattle and wealth. In Gothic, Angla-saxon, and Old Norse, the latter
had become the only meaning, and scot significantly heads the Runic
alphabet. Cp. the analogous development oi Latin pecus, peculium,
pecnnia, Germ. Vnt, and Engl. see, showing that originally cattle
were the only medium oi exchange or barter. gratissimae: ttytty
gratisyt'ng, not tte most yronyyiny, which would be incompatible with
solae. With the statement, cp. also Caes. B. G. VI. 35, Q, mnyno
pecoris numero, enim sant cupidissimi barbari, potiuntur. Argen-
tum et aurum x sor ns recordatam, explanatory oi soloe, the par-
ticles (here nam oronim) being omitted, as often when the important
word is emphasized by its position at the beginning. See note Ayr.
ch. 2, 5. With this sentiment, a commonplace both in classical and
modern literature, cp. eg. Ovid, Met. I. 140, effodiantur opes, inti-
tumentn aratorum· Hor. Germ. lII. 3, 49, cetram inrepertum etsie
melina sitnm eunt terra celat.

20. lieo tamma etc: only apparently contradicts solae . . . opes,
the implicatior being that even it these metals did occur, they were
too rare to constitute opes. As a matter oi fact, when Tacitus wrote
the Annols, he had heard oi the existence oi unproductive mines in
