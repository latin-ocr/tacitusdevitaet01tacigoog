with soldiers or foreigners ; later authors use itin the sense oi cliente,
or oi the uppcr classes, as distinguished from the tunicati (= plebs).

11. iaclle agebat: sc. res iudiciales. focile, with despotcb, as if
he had had legal training. Iam vero: besides, sortitermore ; a ior-
mula oi transition, usually emphatic, occurring occasionally in Tacitus.
curarum remissionumque: also combined in Dici. 28, 27 i.

12. ubi. . . poscerent: the subjunctive ol repeated action with
ubi, occurs only here in the minor works, though common in the His-
tories and Anubis and iu post-Augustas writers generally. con·
ventus ac iudicia: circaitcoorts. Iudicio is added as the more
specific term ior the sake oi nearer definition, according to a charac-
teristic usage in Tacitus. See Introd. p. xxx.

1³. et saepius misericors: sc. erat. On et, ond at ibe sometime,
besides, after an asyndeton, see Introd. p. xxviii. and Hist. IV. 12,
erat ct domi delectus eques,· with saepias as here, ag. Aemili. 74,
pars aitqua militis Romani ic ore, ia latere et saepias a tergo erat. -
On the cumulatius force oi the asyndeton, see Iatrod. p. xxvii. ubl

hisjudicial demeanor. tristitiam . . . exuerat: be bad ccst off
moroseness aad hauteur aad cocetoasncss. The figure, common in
Tacitus, is taken from a dress, which can be put off or on at pleasure.

he neverhad; but Tacitus means to say that as legatus he had divested

which the Romans lrom time immemorial had come to regard as
inseparable lrom it. The ambiguity was due to a striving for con-
crseness.

16. iacllltas: affabiliby, when not acting in au official capacity,
and with the implicatior that he was easily accessible. So again
chlb, 10.

1⁷. integritatem . . . luerit: with the sentiment, cp. Vell. Pat.
11. lb, t, caius (sc. Gatortis) integritatem laudari cesos est—Observa,
