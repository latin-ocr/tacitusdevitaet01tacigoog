111111] noras. enarrarem. 103

The imperfect is here used for rhe'pluperrect, because the Roman
principle 01 completely subjugating what was in reach still held good.
inventus: sc. erat, notasset, 101, although the subjunctive 01 csse is
frequently omitted, when another subjunctive has preceded (cp.
Iatrod. p. xxxii), the rhetorical use 01 the indicative in the apoduein
01 conditional clauses contrary to 1101 isone of the characteristic fea·
tures of Tacitean syntax. Here 11 marks an emphatic contrast to the
unreality of the protasis, which in all like instances except Hist. IV.
19, precedes.

28. Clota et Bodotria: the Fritbs of Olyde and Fortis, the line
itself stretching approximately from Grcenoclc (near Glasgow) to
Ediaburglr. diversi: opposite. See note ch. 11, 8. par fn·
mensum = per mugram spatium. Such expressions are exceedingly
common in Tacitus. See note ch. 10, 13.

29. spatio: strip. About 70 miles.

30. omnis propior sinus: the entire stretcb os territory nearer to
aa, ie. the southern portioris previously occupied by the Romans.
For a similar meaning 01 sinas, here including the west coast and part
of the interior, cp. Gerra. 37, 26.

³1. velutin allam insulam : aliam skillfully marks the transition
to the next chapter, dealing with Ireland. Ι1 Caledonia had been
meant here, Tacitus would have said celat 11 insulam. With firmavit
and terrebatur the author indicates that the Caledonian campaign in
the west was satisfactorily closed, and, as 1 matter 01 fact, the subse-
quent scene of the conflict is shifted to the east.

0111111124. 32. Quinto . . . anno: 82 11). nave prima
ammonens: crossiog over (viz. to Ireland) sor the first time cuith
afleet. If, as is generally assumed, the fleet coasted northward along
the shore, transgressas would be out 01 place. Prima is here, as
often, eg. Germ. 43, ὅ, used adverbially, and its position, while
bringing it in juxtaposition with the verb, at the same time empha- .
sines the significante of tho· achievement. The name Ireland occurs
first in Pytheas; Caes. B. (i. 13, 2, also mentions the island, and sub-
sequently many references to it, often curicus, occur, but it cannot
he said to have been definitely known till the time 01 Ptolemaeus, the
famous geographer 01 the second century an. Agricola, 11 we except
occasional traders, seems to have been, in fact, the first Roman to set
foot upon Ireland, nor was 11 again invaded in Roman times. The
point 01 departure cannot be accurately determined. See map.
