1⁵. diu, eta. ι the ancient amber trade of tha North Sea was in
the hands of the Phoenicium, and therefore of hoaryantiquity. Under
the name oi ἤλεκτρον, amber is mentioned repeatedly in Homer, eg.
onyas. IV. 733 XVIII. 296; also in Herod. III. 115, ἐξ ἐσχάτης Εὐρώπης
. . . τὸ ἤλεκτρον. Subsequently it was brought south overland, one
route leading to the Black Sea, the other through the territory of the
Venedi, the southern neIghbors of the Aestii, ιο Pannonia. Op. esp.
Plin. N. Η. lc. 43, Veneti pnnraem sarnam ei rei secere proximique
Pannoniae. From what follows it would seem that amber as an
artIcle of adornment was not generally introduced among the Romans
till the time of Nero, and it is upon thIs fact that Tacitus, ignoring as
he does the older North Sea trade, apparently bases his otherwise un-
warranted statement. quinetiam: on the anastrophe, cp. note
ah. 3, 29. eiectamenta: probably a Tacitean coinage, found only
here and in Apul. Apol. 35. The more vulgar maris perpetientem, is
used eg. by Pliny, tc. 35.

16. Iacebat: lap neglectae. In this sense especially frequent in
Cicero. In Tacitus again, Ann. XIII. bb. luxurie nostra: tlte
Itonion Ioue os lacurn. dedIt nomen: sc. aucino; broupbt into
fannion, repnte. This meaning of nornen Is generally common.
With the thought, cp. Plin. N. H. ta. 49, in omnibns deniqne aliia
uitiis ant ostentatio ant nans placet, in sucinis sola deliciarum aon-
scientia ; and Agr. 12, 11 i. Ipsis In nulio usu: amber bracelets,
amulets, utensils, weapons, etc, have been found In gram on Aes-
tian territory belongIng to the stone age. Tacitus was here mla·
informed.

17. rude legitur, informe perfertur: ie. it is gutbered in its
rough, natural state, and brought ιο Rome in its shapeless form to be
there manufactured. Rada and informe ure again combined in Diui.
18, 55 20, 12 ; Ana. XII. 35. pretiumque mhantee accipiunt:
so Adam of Bremen says of the Aestii in general: aurunt et arpentum
pro minima ducunt.

18. tamen: i.e. although the Aestii themselves can give no Infor-
matIon on the subiect, the resinoid character of amber is apparent.
Intelleges: on this ‘can-could' potential, see note ch. 30, t.

19. terrena quaedam . . . rolucus: montiay and reingeri crea-
turae. Terrena, oi beings confined to the earth, occurs only here.
Cp. with the collocation, Herod. 1. 140, ἑρπετὰ rai πετηνά; Theocr.
XV. 118, πετεηνὰ καὶ ἑρπετά; Schiller, Waa da tranant aad fleant.
Among the animala found iu amber, Plin. l.c. 46, mentions ants, gnate,
