mergeretur ,· 1v. 110, 4. The following lines in Matthew Arnold’s
Balder Dead are evidently inspired by the present passage :-

Gowards who were in slonghs interred alive,

And round them still the wattled hurdles hung,
Wherewith they stamped them down and trcd them deep
To hide their shameiul memory 110111 men.

insuper: here, ch. 16, 29; 34,22,10 be taken in 010001 sense, bnt
in the remaining twenty-five instances in Tacitus, it means more·
ouer, as eg. in ch. 31, 18; 45, 1.

22. tamquam introducing a substantive clause is a peculiar post-
Augustan substitute 101 the accusative with infinitiva. lt is most
frequent in Tacitus; in the minor works only here; oh. 20, 4; 30, 20;
Diul. 10, 6. 25; 25, 11. Excepting a doubtful passage in Nep. Hanc.
2, 2, the construction is first met with in Seneca Rhetor. scelera

inierence 01 the idealizing author or his authority. cp. Introd. p. lxiii.

23. levioribus delictis: eg. homicide, assault and battery, lar-
ceny, personal libel. pro modo: so. delicti. poena: all these
