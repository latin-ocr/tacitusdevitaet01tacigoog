⁸ PREFAOE
TO. THE AGRIOOLA.

Wax's edition of the Agricola (1852) may be said to constitute
a new landmarlr in the philological labors devoted to the elucida-
tiou of this biography. He incorporated what was still of valne
in the work oi his numerous predecessore, and added not a little
of his own to the improvement oi the text and to a better under-
standing oi its contenta. = Since his time the contributions made
to the criticism and exegesis of the Α yricolc, and to Tacitus gen·
erally, have been very considerable, both in quality and quantity;
but while the historical, ethnological, and syntactical material
thus accumulated is satisfactorily exhaustive, the strictly rhetorical
features of the-Agricola, conspicuous though they are, have hitherto
been persistently and inexplicably overlooked or ignored. And
yet it must be evident that a student can at best acquire but a
very superficial appreciation of the consummate artistic merits of
this treatise if he romain in ignorance cf the vital elementa that
make the Agricola the immortal masterpiece that it is.

Ι have, therefore, been at pains to illustrate and analyze, albeit
under the restrictione necessarily imposed upon a college edition,
all noteworthy rhetorical features in the style and structure of the
Agricola, the synopsis in the introduction being, ior the reason
given above, intentionally more full than might otherwise appear
warranted in an edition oi this nature. The discovery that Taci-
tus, in writing the A yricolo, closely followed timehorrored rhetori-
cal canons ior biographical composition was as great a surprise to
me, who had cuce denied this on the basis of an examination oi
extant classical biographies‚ as it will doubtless be to others. 1
hope, however, that the necessarily brief review ol the evidence
given in the Introduction will suffice tc carry conviction.

In the Notos I have endeavored to face every real difficulty and
to omit no comment, wherever such would be welcome to the

young student, and 1 tr'ust that no wholly irrelevant matter has
