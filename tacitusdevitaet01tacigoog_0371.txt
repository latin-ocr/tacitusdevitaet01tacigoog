The following highly rhetorical passage iumishes the best extant
example oi the fanciiul idealizetion ol unknown northern raeesao
characteristic oi the ancients irom Homer down. Cp. latrod. p. lxiii.
All the Germanic traits oi the Tenui are accentuated, while the ethnl-
cal distinctions are all carefully enumerated and invested with a halo
of romanoe. Some oi the colors ol the picture seem to have been con·
tributed by Lucretius. See below.

1³. non. . .n0n. . . non: on the anaphora here and again ll 19.
22, see Introd. p. lxvii. penaten: i.e. they have no family liic or
iixedhabitations. Cp.ch.15,8; 25,11. viculi herba: ie. they
have no agriculture, but such vegetable food ae they use grows wild.
This could, oi course, be true only for the summer, but Tacitus hahitu-
ally ignores the winter in hie account ci the remote north, doubtless
because the information available to him was originally gethered by
tradere who would visit these regions only in summer. See ll. 181.
and note ch. 45, 26. The slight contradiction between this statement
and l. lt 1. must nothe too closely pressed in a description so largely
imaginative, particularly as it may have been in pert caused by the
Lucretian reminiscence cited below.

14. cubile humus: cubile ior cubiti is intentionally used to mark
the close oi the asyndeton, similar devices being characteristic oi Taci-
tean style. The same phrase occurs, eg. Curt. 111. 2, 5, 15. With
the entire passage, cp. Lucret. V. 816, terro cibumpuerie, uestem uapor,
herbo cubile. selae . . . opes: their ontp resourcee constet ta, as
contrasted with the primitive conditione just mentioned (non urnac . . .
humus). quae. . . ossibusasperant: whose pointetbeptip totth
boae. This is said to have been the practice of the Sarmatians (Pausan.
1. 21, b) and the Hune (Amm. Marc. XXXl. 2, 9), and it is still iu
vogue in Lapland and in northern Siberis.

16. alit: the verb is here perhaps used in the figurative sense oi
pivinp occupatiore to, ior to say that both men and women partook oi
the game is a gratuitous and seli-evident statement, not to mention
that portent . . . petant would thus be en intolerahle tautology.
The whole passage simply describes an active outdoor ure, taken up
for the most part with the chase. passim : in all directione, de·
rived irom pondo, to spread. In Tacitus this meaning occurs only here
and Hiet. i. 8l; Ana. VI. 50; XI. 32. comitantur: sc. feminae
atros. partem praedae petunt: alliterative. The entire statement
is confirmed by Procopius (eth century), whose description of the Fenni
in general is in remarkable agreement with the account oi Tacitus.
