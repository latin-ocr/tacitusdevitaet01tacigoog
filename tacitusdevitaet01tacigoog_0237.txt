This matchless epilogus (ch. 45, 2511), so 11111 04 pieroing tenderness
and solemn eloquence, is in its reflectione to a large extent made up 01
well-known and often recurring rhetorical commonplaces, but such
is the consummate art 04 Tacitus that he has nevertheless hreathed a
nevv originality into horrowed material, and at the same 1111101ιο-
ceeded in creating the indelible impression oi a spontaneous and
deeply sincere cutburst 01 sorrow and affection. See alsa Introd.

28. latum excepisti: Tacitus has some thirty phrases ior death

expressions. Cp. in this treatise, eh. 1,14; 2,18; 3, 19. 24; t, 3;

giving the inierence 04 others (l. 27), according to Tacitean umge,
on which see note ch. 15, 19, is based more particularly upon libens,
ior a man such as Agricola must he assumed to have met death
constane, even 14 there had been 110 suspicion 01 10111 play. That he
should by his manner have given the impression 01 exonerating Domi-
tian would be quite in accord with his character, as drawn in this
treatise. pro virili portione: apparently a new coinage to avoid
the hackneyed pro virili parte (not in Tacitus). The phrase occurs
also Hiet. Ili. 20, but is generally very rare. cp. Introd. p. xxv.
