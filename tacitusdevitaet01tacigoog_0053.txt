Again, if, as many scholars maintain, the Germania was
primarily designed for Trajan, and secondarily for the
Roman public, then Tacitus' treatiso was nothing less than
an act ol presumption and supererogation, for whatever
Trajan's plans may have been, he was certainly in excep
tionally favorable circumstances to learn at first huod what
the author of the Germanic could only have ascertaincd at
second baad, not to mention that the information concerning
the tribes beyond the Elbo, and of the remote North, would
have been both useless and irrelevant, for even in the wild-
est flights of alleged Roman expansionists, the conquest,
eg. of the Fanni, Sitones, and Aestii could never have been
contemplated.

To these consideratione, quite sufficient to disprove the
hypothesis of the politica] purpose of the Germanic, two
others may be added which, though equally strong, have
hitherto been overlooked.

The object of the historical retrospect in ch. 37, which
deals with the disasters sustained by Roman arms at the
hands of northern barbarians withinaperiodof two centurias,
has generally been supposed to be to inculcata the futility

1Tha inherent absurdity oi tho theory seems to have been felt by
Mdllenhoff, but ho endeavors to neutralize it by an assertion so as-
tounding that it will be well to quote his own words, p. 16: “That
this special motivo and purpose (ie. the political) was suppressed by
Tacitus could only enhancc the effectiveness of the treatise. . ..
Everything, and even this silence, thus points'to this aim.'‘ By such
reasoning almost anything could bs demonstrated.
