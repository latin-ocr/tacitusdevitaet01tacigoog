Tacitus wholly'ignores the Burgodiones, &succensuerunt
and knows of but one pens Chaucorum.

But it is upon the description of amber (oh. 45) that
Tacitean indebtcdness to Pliny's encyclopaedia is alleged to
rest most securely, for the latter devotos no fewer than
sixteen paragraphs to this very subject (N. H. XXXVII. 2,
11, 30-46), bis very enumeration of the many authors who
dealt with the origin and provenance of amber showing
clearly, as may be observed in passing, that an extensive
literature concerning this substance existed before Pliny's
time. Now, it is certainly not without significance that the
oue noteworthy agreement¹ between him and Tacitus (for
the other coincidences of statement pertain to details ol
unquestionably common knowledge and observation) is
expressly cited as a fact known to prisci nostri. On the
other hand, Tacitus gives a number of details not found in
’ Pliny. Thus the former conspicuously mentions the Aestii
as engaged in the amber trade, and speaks only of the Baltic

Sea3 the latter says nothing of this tribe, and refers only

to the shores of the North Sea as the region where the
amber came from.²

If any further proof of Tacitus' independence of Pliny
were needed, it would be furnisbed by their widely dis-
crepant and irreconcilable descriptions of the Chauci.⁸ Pliny
pictures them as living in sordid ¹poverty and devoid of all

wrote Suionibus (mentioned by T. immediately aiter his account of
amber) instead of Guionibus, an otherwise wholly unknown name
which he cites from Pytheas.
