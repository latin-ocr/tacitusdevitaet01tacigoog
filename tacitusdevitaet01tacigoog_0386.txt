Professor Etleuam thfflin, in the Archiv fit'r Lateinisclre chikographie
und Grammatik. February¹ 1896. Aut geringem Raume ist viel wis-
senswiirdiges zusammengedrtingt und zwar mit praktischem Geschiclre;
zwei langere Listen geben die lateinischen Wo'rter von bestrittener Quan-
titttt und Orthographie‚ wobei die Anstitze von Marx oft berichtigt sind.
. . . Die deutsche Wissenschaft wird sich nur freuen dass das ameriltan-
ische Schulwesen ein so brauchbares Hilfsmittel gewonnen hat.

Hdhe des heutigen Wissens.

Professor llarry Thurston Peck, Columbia college, N.ll..· lt is no exag-
geration to say that so compact¹ helpful and practical a collection of
indispensable information cannot be found elsewhere in any language
whatsoever. Even in Germany, the home of classica} enchiridia, nothing
has yet appeared that is so satisfactory. Professor Bennett seems to
divine by instinct just what questions arise in the mind ol the student,
and he here answers them in advance in a delightfully lucid and simple
fashion. . . . Everywhere the best authorities are cited; and it is certain
that to many reachers‚ as well as students, the mere perusal of this little
manual will open up many new visttts¹ and will put them in touch with the
most scholarly doctrine of the day. ln fact the book is one that no pro-
gressive instructor can afford to be without, as it summarizes an immense
amount of information'that is of the utmost practical importance.
