That the worlrs of Posidonius, moro particularly the
exhaustive account of the Cimbri and Teutones, must have
constituted a welcome repository of trustworthy informa
tion on Germany can still be shown, for apert from the fact
already pointed out, that the above-mentioned narrative
remained the standard treatment of those tribes, we owe to
Posidonius the first mention of the name Gerraoni1 and the
first description of that country.²

Under these circumstances, it does not seem probable that
Tacitus would have failed to avail himself of the labors of
so reliable, so suggestive, and so learned an authority, whose
very attitude of mind and point of view, moreover, as mani-
fested, eg, in his tendenoy to idealize barbarian races, must
have been singularly sympathetic to our author.⁸ Although
the precise nature and extent of this indcbtedness must, of
course, remain problematical, there is at least one piece of
detailcd information in the Germanic for which Posidonius

seems reasonably certain to have been, if not the direct, yet
the ultimate source.

¹Athen. IV. p. 153 e. Milllonhofi, D. A.11. pp. 153 n, intent
upon proviug that Caesar was the first to distinguish the Celts from
the Germane, is finally driven to the arbitrary hypothesis that Athe-
naeus interpolated the name into his direct citation from Posidonius,
and that Strabo, Valerius Maximus, Velleius, and Diodorus all wan-
tonly changed the terms raherei, Κελτοί, or Galli, given in their
sources, to Germani. But Caesar was already acquainted with the
latter designation before hc encountered German tribes, and as ho
regards the cimbri and Teutones as Germanic, nothing is more
plausible than thet their great historiam, Posidonius, had done so
too. cp. also Philol. LVIII. p. 29. Caesar knew but few trans·
Rhenish people intimately, and, ii he clearly difierentiated these from
the Celtic Gauls, it does not follow that he had determined the racial
distinctions oi the German peoples as a whole, as Tacitus did, on tho
strength oi the extensive information at his disposal.
