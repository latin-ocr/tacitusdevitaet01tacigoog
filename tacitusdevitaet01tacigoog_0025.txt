and genuine reproductiou.¹

The ancients resorted tc this rhetorical expedient iu the
conviction that by so doing they could more vividly and
objectively portray the feelings and the motives by which
the principa] characters were actuated, and thus at the
same time detine the issues and reflect the spirit of the
contending parties²

Now, inasmuch as Tacitus was writing the life, not of a
poet or scientist or philosopher, but of a general who was
himseli helping to make history, it was inevitable that he
should deal with πράξεις, which were the special province of
the historiau, and thus the rhetorical exigencies oi historieal
prose cf which speeohes constituted an integral part, would
be sufficient to justify their insertion in this strictly histori-
cal portion of his biography. It the speeohes cf Calgacus
and Agricola are to be condemned as irrelevant in a genuine
biography‚ the description of the battle, constitutiug as it
did an equally integral feature cf historica] narrative,⁸
should have met with the same condemnation, and yet no
one has ever made the least objection to it in spite of its
rhetorical and all but imaginative character.⁴

2 The stereotyped rhetorical character ol these military harengues is
perhaps best shown by the numerous parallelisms in sentiment, often
expressed in similar phraseology‚ found in the speeohes oi Thneydides‚
Livy, Curtius, and Sallust, although in the case ol the last mentioned
direct indebtedness oi Tacitus is reasonably certain. See below.
