18. poenarum: death penalties. See below diversitos supplicii.
Other crimes, though not belonging to leniore delicta and not punished
by death, are here ignored, Tacitus having in mind only those conr·
mitted against thecommunity as such. ex delicto: inproportionto
the character os the offense. Proditores et 110110111ςο01 theseterms
aud desertor are naturally often combined, ag. Hist. 1.72; 1V.58;
Ana. II. 1⁰3 IV. 48. They are not synonymus, transfugium and
desertio being often only distinct manifestatione of proditio. It has
frequently been maintained that Tacitus has here been inconsistent
with his statements in ch. 6, 25, and 14, 20, concerning the infamy
attaching to deserters, but he is there speaking only of men who would
be beyond tlte renen os the lew. Desertion‚ like other acts of treason,
was punishable by death in the laws of Charles the Great, and has
, remained a capital offense down to the present time.

19. arboribus suspendunt: as this was the official mode 010110-
001100 101 11011010, 11 may explain in a measure the reason why some
deserters, mentioned in 011. 6, 25, committed suicide by donnino.
ignavos et imbelles: anot uncommon connection, but of varied
meaning. Cp. Liv. XXVI. 2, 11, ignavi et imbelles inter bostis essent;
Agr. 15, 26, merely by way of reproach. In Germ. 31, 16, 11 stands
ior those physically weak and unfit for war. Here the phrase implies
an overt act of cowardice and may include deserters who were caught
in the attempt. According to Norse law, the coward in battle could
be killed on the spot.

20. corpore infames: the three elements in this enumeration are
emphasized by polysyndeton and alliteration, the last member being
amplified. cp.1nnod.p.lxvii. The same phrase occurs inAnn. I. 73,
and refers to unnatural vices,'an instance being recorded among the
Batavians by Tacitus himself, in Hist. IV. 14. caeno . . . mer-
grmt: this is abundantly attested ¹for much later times. Cp. the
northern apic, Gotbrnnnriecitlte 111.10‚ they led the nornen into a
soni swantp. In East Frisia, in 1811, a female skeieton, bound with
wickerwork, was found in the depths of amoor. This modo of
punishment, though not ior the iastnamed chance, was also practised
by the Persians, and the Carthaginians, and was not unknown to the
early Romans. Cp. Herod. VII. 114; Xen. Anab. 1. 6, 11 (the death
of Orontes) ; Plaut. Poen. V. 2, 65 (vs, 1026), snb cratini nt iubeas se
