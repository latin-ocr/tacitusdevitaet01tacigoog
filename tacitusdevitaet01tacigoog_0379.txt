of recedere in Pomp. Mela, 111. 1, 8, editors have followed Heraeus in
rejecting a wholly unobjectiouable word against the unanimous tes-
timony of the MSS. But, not to mention that au emendation not
called for by textual corruption, excellent though it be, is ipso sacto
false, the same figurative use of redire is found not only in Verg.
