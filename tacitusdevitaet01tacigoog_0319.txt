with Caes. B. (i. IV. 1, 7, VI. 222 if, the only other extant treat-
ment of the subject, is perhaps the most unsatisfactory in the entire
Germania. Nor can the trustworthiness of the account be determined,
as there is an interval oi more than a century between Caesar and
Tacitus. On the other hand, the earliest post-Tacitean documenta on
German land tenure are as late as the oth century, and they relate
ιο agricultural communities with permanent abedoc, whereas the
Germane of Tacitus* time had not yet altogether emerged from their
primitive nomadic state; but the changes in land tenure incident ιο
that evoluticn must have been many and significant. What the author
meant to say, will nevertheless be found tolerably clear, it we emanci-
pate ourselves from the misleading information of arelatively modern
date. pro numero cultorum: the migrating, conquering tribes
occupied only so much of the acquired extensive domains as could be
tilled or utilized; subsequently, definite allotrnents were parcellad out
in accordance with the rank oi the several occupants. This phrase, of
course, implies a previous scale of distribution, which served aea
criterion.

by Caesar, are strangeiy ignored by Tacitus. They would bave ud-
mirably subserved his idealizing tendency, lor, as the following shows,
he was not convinced that this change irom tilled to fallow lands was
made ιο relieve the soil before exhaustion. The agricultural principle

change so often, since they do not utilize the potential richness and
the area oi the soil ιο its utmost capacity, by planting orchards, etc,
which, though requiring considerably more time, would, on the other
hand, yield more satisfactory and better developed products.
