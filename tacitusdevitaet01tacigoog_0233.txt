Cp. aleo Dio Cass. LXVI. 20, έν τε ἀτιμίᾳ τὸ λοιπὸν τοῦ βίον καὶ ἐν
ἐνδείᾳ . . . ἔζησεν. Quippe: frequentin Tacitus in the sense oi
enim or nam, with the usual ellipsis But this laolr oi worldly goods
Agricola hore with resignation, ior, etc. He thus formed'a marked
contrast to Asinius Marcellus, oi whom Tac. Aah. XIV. 40, says:
clame neque morum menendus habebatur, niet quod paupertatem
praecipuum mulorum credebat.

29. vera bona, etc, ε the well-known Stolo doctrine that the wise
and virtuous man is rich and a king.

³0. impleverat: he crcjoged to the folleat extent, were his ia
abuudance. In Tacitus again, Hice. I. 16, impletum est omne coneil-
ium, si te hene elegi, hut quite frequent elsewhere. —It isakind oi

Rauennatem classem (= handed over through the treason ol). cp.
lotroci. p. xxxiii. et consulari: On the consulship as the goel ota
Roman’e ambition‚ see note Diui. 13, 29.

Pago 30. 1. triumphalibus, etc: in this passage the honor of
the triumphal ornaments is treated with less depreciation than in ch.
40, 21. All such distinctions were, however, regarded hythe Stoice
as ἀδιάφορα. Cp. Tae. Huc. lv. 5, ssepi ἶψους, 44. adimere:
hostete iu additio-n. In thie figurative sense first in ovid, A. A. 11.

2. fllia . . . superstitibus: on the ablativa absolute at the close,
see Intred. p. xxvii. potest . . . effugium on the collocatio ver·
borum, cp. note ch. 42, 24.

3. dignitate = dignitate senatorio. So again Aac. III. 1'i; with-
out the ellipsis, Aren. 111. 30; XVI. 17,

4. adfinitatibus et amicitiis = adtribue et amicis, here used in
an asyndetic enumeration, because the preceding nouus are abstract.
cp. note ch. 16, 21. —The concrete sense oi the former occurs in Taci-
tus only here and Ano. XI. 243 oi the latter, Hist. Ι, 1ος 11. 63. 87;
Aac. 11. 27.17; IV. 40; V. 2. The thought is a commonplace, as is
clear from Menander, Rhet. Gr. IX. 293 (ΙΙΙ. 420).

6. augurio votisque: correspcnd chiastically to durare in . . .
