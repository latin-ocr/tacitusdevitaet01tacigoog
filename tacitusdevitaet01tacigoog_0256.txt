them certain chants, etc. For a similar meaning of tace, which has
been variously interpreted, see Dicl. 12, 8, lucrosae tatus . . . elo·
quentiae usus reseas (the mottey-ycttiay eloquente os toucy is a modern
practice). relatu: recitat. A very rare word, occurring first in
ovid, Fast. III. 541. ln Tacitus again, Hist. I. 30, relatu virtutum.
20. harditum: shicld scay, connected with Old Norse bardili, a
stield, not with barti, which is purely Celtic, norwith heard, which
does notsuit the present context. The barritum, with which tarditas
has often been identified, though used oi a battle shout and ol the cry

oi elephanta, was apparently quite different, to J'udge by its repeated
description in Ammianus Marcellinus and other writers.

21. ipso cantu: ie. without reference to the contents ol the chaat.

22. vocis ssis. . . virtutis concentus: A hcrmoay cs votor
rather ttaa os voice. It represented not so much a musical harmony,
as one militant spirit pervading the ranks. On the alliterative
antithesis, a lavorite device of Tacitus, cp. Iatrod. Ape. p. xxviii. In
this treatise again, ch. 14, 31.

2³. Adiectatur: on the emphatic position oi the verb, see Iatrool.
p. lxyi. lt agrees in the singular with the nearer noun, and so gener-
ally, when placed at the beginning, as the predicate oi two subiecta

24. tractum: subducti. So Tac. Aua. XIV. 20, fractos sonos.

25. maslot: deeper. ceterum: here merely a transitional
particle, i.e. not only are we told that Hercules came, but even
Ulysses, etc.

26. quidum opinantes: Probably Posidonius is the earliest
authority for this information. cp. also Solinus, XXII. l, who is
chiefly indebted to Pliny: ia quo recessu Ulixen Caledonius adpul-
sum secuuntur ara Graecis titteris inscripto, and latret. p. lvii.
According to Kratas oi Mallos, the famous head oi the school oi
Pergamum (td cent. Μ), Odysseus reached India by crossing the
Atlantia. Thereaiter we hear oi various citios founded by him, as
Odyssea in Iberia, Olisippo in Spain (Lusitania), and traces oi his
presence cn the Rhine were also found. Cp. claudian, lu Rufius. 1.
123. Douhtless all these traditione owe their origin to iancied re-
semblances to the name Ulixes, as Olisippo above, and possibly
Ulohoxis in Germany. Opiacatur implies a less degree of oredibility
than memorant. cp. Dicl. 2, 11. illo: on the medial position, cp.
Iatrod. p. lxvi. · fabuloso: renouata ia story. So ag. Hor. out
22, 8, fabulosus Hydaspes, but in its usual sense, eh. 46, 24.
