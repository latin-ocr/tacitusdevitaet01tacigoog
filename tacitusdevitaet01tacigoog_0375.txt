hesitation in making the change in accordance with the consistent
usage of Tacitus, on which see Introd. p. lxviii. The two conjunctione
are habitually confounded in our MSS. ; so eg. ch. 7, 13.

5, 30. Argentum quoque] amentemque-H. Schiitz. And be-
sides, moreoocr, is a frequent meaning 01 initial -qac If qaoque were
correct, sequantur quoquc arpentum, 010, would have been called for.

Quoque and 000 are also repeatedly confused in our MSS. Cp. eg.
Dici. ch. 22, 32, locosque for locos qaoquc; 34, 25, bodie quoquc for
hodieque ,· Liv. Ι. 17, 19, XL. 12, 10.

8, 24. Aibrunam] ldibrunam. The name is hopelessly cor-
rupted in our MSS, the generally accepted emendation of Wacker-
nagel being based upon a purely conjectural etymology. See also
note ad loc.

9, 30. liburnae] liburnicae. See PH. p. 301.

10, 10. consultetur] concalitur—Walch ; consuletur-MSS.
See note ad loc.

10, 22. sed apud proceres: sacerdotes enim] a. p. sed 0. a,
sc enim. Halm, 000100000008101100, etc, in Berfcbte der 1111000.
Akcd. 1304, p. 30, suggested the transposition 01 sed. It is omitted

¹ before apud proceres in 011 but two MSS, one of these being of no
a.. hority. The particle was doubtless written above the line in the
archetype, and hence some scribes inserted it in the wrong place,
the great majority overlooking it altogether. 80 enim, on the other
hand, isfound in all the MSS. See also note ad loc.

10, 23. explorant] explorantur—B; exploratur-Atta The
passive plural seems 10 me preferable. Similar variants, owing to
abbreviatione of the endings, are exceedingly common in MSS. In
thistreatise, e. g. the following readings, ch. 0, 12, 0011000001οη 27,
ab, observatar; 44, ’1,0000001,1 40, 30, differuntur, are untenable.

11, i. praetractentur] pertractentur-MSS, except CD2V. The
error was due to the abbreviation ὄν. cp. PH. p. 40.

11, 9. turba] iarbae-MSS. The conjecture 01 Gronovius,
though accepted by many, is rendered impossible by the context 01
the preceding clause. Ut iarbae placuit is but another citiam 00
libertate. If this hypothetical chairman could have called tlte great
assembly to order (ior with turba placuit we must supply praesidi)
whenever he 'savv what appeared tobim a sufficiently large number to
constitute a ‘quorum' the phrase 000 01 iacet· conueniant would
involve a contradiction.

11, ll. princeps] princpes—Perizonius. Cp. PH. p. 40.
