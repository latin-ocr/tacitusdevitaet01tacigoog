. . . sed etiarn, as olten when correlative ; hence also the repetition 61
6116 proposition. cp. Introd. p. lxvii.

11. ceteros: i.e. Germanos qui non repnentur. We should ex-
pect ceteros, 66. pentes, and perhaps Tacitus wrote thus. impares
libertini: the inferiorita os tho freerneu. The adjective impares is
used for the abstract noun (which does not exist in Latin) and a
genitive. This construction, though especially frequent in Tacitus, is
used by him preferably with participles and pronominal adjectives.
, The original distinction between libertus, the freedman in relation to
tho manumitter, and libertinus, in his relation to his social or political
status, is no longer rigidly observed in postAugustan Latin, and would
in any case he inapplicahle to Germanic conditions. With the state-
ment itseli, cp. Aac. XIV. 39.

Chapter 26. 13. Faenus: here used in the rare sense of sora,

capitol, not interest. So Plaut. Most. 111. 1, 101 (vs. 629); Cic. od
Ait. VI. i, 4, and in tour other passages 61 Tacitus, viz. Hiat. I. 20;
Ana. VI. 17; XIV. 63, oo. agitare: exercere, 6166666, handle.

expression ‘to drive abargain.' in usuras extendere sc. soerias.
Cp. Aua. VI. 16, pecunius foenore orrctitobont. The statement is
somewhat inconsistent with ch. t, 23 11, which seems to preclude tho
possibility 61 systematic money transactione. cp. what is said even
61 the savage Fanni in ch. 46, 21.

14. magis servatur, etc: i.e. this ignorance oi usury is better
maintained than 11 its practice had been forbidden. The Germane,
being unacquainted with ,1666116 agitare, 666, were thus not even
tempted to introduce it. The usual interpretation oi this, in any case
strained‚ epigram, which supplies saeuus aon 6916666, etc, as subject
oi seruatur and the positive again with vetitum esset, involves an
exceedinglyharsh ellipsis, unpa-ralleled even in Tacitus. He frequently
allows the positive idea to be supplied 611661 aprevious negative ex-
pression, but never the reverse. Cp. note 1116134, 10. vetitum
esset: as was frequently done in Rome, eg. by the 166 Genucio, in
31666. Tor a detailed account of the legislation in regard to the

legal rates oi interest, see Anu. VI. 16. For a somewhat similar
epigrammatic antithesis, cp. Justin. Ii. 2 (cited note ch. 46, 23).

Agri, etc: this passage, owing to the studied conciseness of the
author, acorruption in the MSS. (in 61666), and certain discrepancies
