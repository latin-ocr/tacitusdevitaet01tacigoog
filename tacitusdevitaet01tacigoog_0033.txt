Tacitus is not only the greatest historiari whom Rome
produced, but he is also one ol the greatest stylistic artists
in the world’s literature.

Equipped with the most thorough rhetorical training
which his time afforded (and without such, it must be remem-
bered‚ no ancient author, least of all in the postAugustan
age, could hope for recognition or an abiding rancun),
Tacitus began his career as a writer with the brilliant
Dialogus dc oratoribus. This exhibite the youthful author
still completely under the spell of the exuberant diction of
(licem, a return to whose style Quintilian, Tacitus's great
toacher, advocated with lifelong enthusiasm, to offset the
corrupting influence oi Seneca. Nearly twenty years were
to elapse before Tacitus broke the silence imposcd by the
despotism of Domitian with the publication of the Agricola.
The great difference which confronts us in the style of the
two treatises is easily accounted for, but only one of the
. causesl calls for special mention here. The exigencies of
artistic prose imperatirely demanded a distinctly different
treatment for each species of literary composition, a his·
tory‚ an encomium, a speech, or a letter exhibiting a stylis
tic type peculiarly distinct, Now, when Tacitus designed
the Agricola, he conformed to existing rhetorical canons for
the βασιλικὸς λόγος, 01· biographical eulogy, as we have seen,
but forits stylistic framework he selected as his model
the historiari Sallust! And certainly Sallust's ‘immortal
swiftness,' his epigrammatic directness and general sty-

auctor, with which estimato Martial, Tacitus's contemporary, fully
agrees. Cp. Bk. XIV. 191, Prtmm Romatio Crispus ta historia.
