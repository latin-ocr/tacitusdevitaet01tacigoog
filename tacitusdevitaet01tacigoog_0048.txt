THE PURPOSE cu THE crunnum

Wunrr Tacitus published the Agricola, in 98 nn, he had
already planned, as we learn from his preiaoe (ch. 3, 29 i),
the composition of a History cf his Own Times. It appeared
about a decade later, and comprised the narrative from the
death of Nero to that oi Domitian (68-96 nn), the story
being subsequently supplemented by the Annols, dealing
with thc preceding period from the death of Augustus
(14 nn).

NoW, among the events which occurred within the first
century oi the Empire's existence, few can be mentioned
that ried in intrinsic importance with the constant struggles
of Rome with the barbarian tribes of Germany,-a fact
made conspicuously apparent by the amount oi attention
which Tacitus devotos to this subject in the works referred
to. Under these circumstances, the conscientious historian
must have felt the need of gathering from all sources
accessiblc to him-and they lay in profusion around him
-what could be learned concerning these semi-civilized
tribes of the North, who had so often routed Roman legions
and proved so effective a barrier against Roman aggression
and world-dominion. The material thus secured must soon

have accumulated to an extent which made it impossible
