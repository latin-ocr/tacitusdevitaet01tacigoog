vivid description or analytic reflectione that his diction as
well becomes pitched in a higher hey. So far, then, from
exhibiting aunifcrm type, the style 01 this treatise cbbs and
flows, as it were, with the character 01 the subjectmatter,
ranging from severely condensed narration to passages 01
genuine eloquence and rhetorical 001,ι thus giving to the
entire work that σεμνότης, or serious dignity of expression,
which Pliny the Yonnger ascribed to the speeches 01
Tacitus, and which may justly bc applied tc everything else
that this great writer ever penned.

An equally conspicuous feature 01 his style is its hrcvlty,
though this is less noticcable in the speeches and in the
numerous elevated passages, which from their very nature
called for greater rhetorical elaboration. This conciseness
is chiefly brought about through the omission of all parts 01
speech which an attentive reader could himself supply in
thought, the ellipsis 01 the copiola and partiales being espe-
cially frequent. But what distinguishes the Germanic more
particularly from all other Tacitean works is the extent to
which 011 periodic structure is avoided. Our treatise is hence
largely made up 01 very short sentences, and it thus ap-
proaches closely in this respect to the socalled Asianic type
01 composition,² which in Latin literature is best represented
by Seneca. In Tacitus, however, this mode 01 writing is
throughout solely 0 means to an end, admirably subserviug
the double purpose 01 crowding his multifarious and exten-
sive information within a very small compass, and at the
same time 01 bringing each single item into prominent and
clearcut relies. The readcr is thus enabled tc survey the
