Prae tc] noras. enarrare 45. 279

11. laborant: tltea cultivate. As a transitive verb ior elaborare,
the verb is quite common in poetry ; hut in the sense called for here,
it seems not ιο occur elsewhere. otmaro scrutantur: as mare
cannot mean seasltore (cp. below, l. 13), the usual interpretation
which regards this clause as a general statement more closely defined

by the epexegetic ac, ete, is untenahle. There is in all probability a Ι

reference here ιο saal fleheries, at least Adamas Bremea (llth cen-
tury) still says of the Aestii, pellibus abaaalaat percariaie; and Taci-
tus himself seems to allude to the same occupation in ch. 17, 12, where
exterior Oceaam et iactatam enare designatas the Baitia. The identi-
cal phrase occurs Aac. 30, 30.

12. ac = ac praeterea. So often. soli omnium: sc. Germa·
abraae. This statement flatly contradicts all that we know of the
provenance of amber, for the Phoenicians brought it at avery early
date from the shores of the North διο, nor did Pytheas, cited by
Pliny in his elaborate account oi this substance (N. H. XXXVII. 2,
11, 31-51), have reference to any other regions; finally it was there
that the Romans became acquainted with it in the expedition of
Drusus (12 me). The fact that Tacitus speaks only of the Baltic
Aestii in this connection may imply that in his time the collection
of amber on the shores of the North Sea had been wholly abandoned.
In any ease, it disproves the universal assumption that his account is
based upon that of Pliny. See also below, and Iatroel. p. liii. ipsi
glaseum vocent: this is a Teutonic word, the same as our place ,· the
Lettic languages, ιο which the Aestian belonged, style it pcatars,
praterea, dsiatars ,· but as Tacitus, misled by his authorities, regarded
the Aestii as Suebic Germane, he naturally took placeam to be their
word for saciaaat. cp. also Plin. N. H. tc. 42, certaria est . . . ab
Germanis adpellari placeam.

aaa or altat process piace riae ιο a. ’

14. ut barbaris: ielis, at t'a barbaris, aa ιο ta he expected
amona barbaricas. For this frequent use of at, cp. note ch. 2, 8.
On the subjective dative, see note ch. 3, 30. quaesitum comper·
tumve: the former refers more particularly to actara, the latter to
ratio. Cp. note ch. 2, 2. The following is one of the extremely few

passages of the Germania alluded ιο by later writers, for Cassiodorus, .

in a letter to these very Aestii, gives thern the information which they
are here said ιο have lacked, hoc qaedam (sie 1) Cornelio scribente lepi-
ιον, etc.
